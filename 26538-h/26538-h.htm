<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>COMMENCEMENT DAY AT MISS TOLLIVER&#8217;S</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;O Phil, dear! It is anything but
fair. If you only knew how I hate to
have to do it!&#8221; exclaimed Madge
Morton impulsively, throwing her arms about
her chum&#8217;s neck and burying her red-brown
head in the soft, white folds of Phyllis Alden&#8217;s
graduation gown. &#8220;No one in our class wishes
me to be the valedictorian. You know you are the
most popular girl in our school. Yet here I am
the one chosen to stand up before everyone and
read my stupid essay when your average was
just exactly as high as mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge Morton and Phyllis Alden were alone
in their own room at the end of the dormitory
of Miss Matilda Tolliver&#8217;s Select School for
Girls, at Harborpoint, one morning late in May.
Through the halls one could hear occasional
bursts of girlish laughter, and the murmur of
voices betokened unusual excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>It was the morning of the annual spring commencement.</p>
<p>Phyllis slowly unclasped Madge&#8217;s arms from
about her neck and gazed at her companion
steadfastly, a flush on her usually pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you say another word about that old valedictory,
I shall never forgive you!&#8221; she declared
vehemently. &#8220;You know that Miss Tolliver is
going to announce to the audience that our averages
were the same. You were chosen to deliver
the valedictory because you can make a
speech so much better than I. What is the use
of bringing up this subject now, just a few minutes
before our commencement begins? You
know how often we have talked this over before,
and that I told Miss Matilda that I wished
you to be the valedictorian instead of me, even
before she selected you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s earnest black eyes looked sternly into
Madge&#8217;s troubled blue ones. &#8220;If you begin
worrying about that now, you won&#8217;t be able to
read your essay half as well,&#8221; declared Phil impatiently.
&#8220;Please sit still for a minute and
wait until Miss Jenny Ann calls us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil pushed Madge gently toward the big armchair.
Then she walked over to stand by the
window, in order to watch the carriages drive up
to Miss Tolliver&#8217;s door and to keep her back
turned directly upon her friend Madge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>The little captain sat very still for a few minutes.
She had on an exquisite white organdie
gown, a white sash, white slippers and white
silk stockings. In the knot of sunny curled hair
drawn high upon her head she wore a single
white rose. A bunch of roses lay in her lap,
also a manuscript in Madge&#8217;s slightly vertical
handwriting, which she fingered restlessly.</p>
<p>The silence grew monotonous to Madge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you angry with me, Phil?&#8221; she asked
forlornly.</p>
<p>Madge and Phyllis Alden had been best
friends for four years, and had never had a real
disagreement until this morning.</p>
<p>Phyllis was too honest to be deceitful. &#8220;I am
a little cross,&#8221; she admitted without turning
around. &#8220;I wish Lillian and Eleanor would
come upstairs to tell us how many people have
arrived for the commencement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge started across the room toward Phil.
But Phyllis&#8217;s back was uncompromising. She
pretended not to hear her friend&#8217;s light step.
Suddenly Madge&#8217;s expression changed. The
color rose to her face and her eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t apologize to you, Phil,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I had intended to, but I see no reason why I
should not say it is unfair for me to be the valedictorian
when you have the same claim to it
that I have. It is hateful in you not to understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
how I feel about it. I am going to find
Miss Jenny Ann.&#8221; Madge&#8217;s voice broke.</p>
<p>A knock on the door interrupted the two girls.
Madge opened the door to a boy, who handed her
a small parcel addressed in a curious handwriting
to &#8220;Miss Madge Morton.&#8221; The letters
were printed, but the writing did not look
like a child&#8217;s. It was the fiftieth graduating
gift that she had received. Phil&#8217;s number had
already reached the half-hundred mark.</p>
<p>Madge dropped her newest package on the
bed without opening it. She was half-way out
in the hall when Phyllis pulled her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look me straight in the face,&#8221; ordered Phil.
Madge obeyed, the flash in her eyes fading
swiftly. &#8220;Now, see here, dear,&#8221; argued Phyllis,
&#8220;suppose that Miss Matilda had chosen me to
deliver the valedictory instead of you, wouldn&#8217;t
you have been glad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge nodded happily. &#8220;I should say I
would,&#8221; she murmured fervently.</p>
<p>Phyllis laughed, then leaned over and kissed
her friend triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you have said just what I wanted to
make you say,&#8221; went on Phil. &#8220;You say you
would be glad if Miss Tolliver had chosen me
for the valedictorian instead of you. Why can&#8217;t
you let me have the same feeling about you?
Please, please understand, Madge, dear&#8221;&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
tears started to Phil&#8217;s eyes&mdash;&#8220;that no one has
been unfair to me because you were Miss Matilda&#8217;s
choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge glanced nervously at the little gold
clock on their mantel shelf. &#8220;It is nearly time
for the entertainment to begin, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she inquired.
&#8220;I suppose Miss Jenny Ann will call
us in time. What a lot of noise the girls are
making in the hall!&#8221;</p>
<p>She idly untied her latest graduating gift. It
was a small box, made after a fashion of long
years ago, and its tops and sides were encrusted
with tiny shells. On one side of the box the
word &#8220;Madge&#8221; was worked out in tiny shells
as clear and beautiful as jewels. Inside the box,
on a piece of cotton, was a single, wonderful
pearl. It was unset, but the two girls realized
that it was rarely beautiful. There was no name
in the box, no card to show from whom it came.</p>
<p>Madge turned the box upside down and peered
inside of it. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who could have
sent this to me,&#8221; she declared, in a puzzled fashion.
&#8220;Mrs. Curtis is the only rich person I
know in the whole world, and she has already
given us her presents. I must show this to
Uncle and Aunt. I am afraid they won&#8217;t wish
me to keep it. But I don&#8217;t know how we are
ever going to return it to the giver when he or
she is anonymous.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Miss Jenny Ann calling?&#8221; Madge
turned pale with the excitement of the coming
hour and thrust the gift under her pillow.</p>
<p>Phyllis picked up a great bunch of red roses.
The eventful moment had arrived. The graduating
exercises at Miss Matilda Tolliver&#8217;s were
about to begin!</p>
<p>Neither of the two girls knew how they walked
up on the stage. Before them swam &#8220;a sea of
upturned faces.&#8221; It was impossible to tell one
person from another. When Madge and Phil
overcame their fright they discovered that they
were among the twelve girl graduates, who
formed a white semi-circle about the stage, and
that Miss Matilda Tolliver was making an address
of welcome to the audience.</p>
<p>Phyllis had no dreaded speech ahead of her.
She looked out over the audience and saw her
father and mother, Dr. and Mrs. Alden; and
Madge&#8217;s uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Butler;
but Madge could think of nothing save the terrifying
fact that she must soon deliver her valedictory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge,&#8221; whispered Phil softly, &#8220;don&#8217;t look
so frightened. You know you have made
speeches before and have acted before people.
I am not a bit afraid you will fail. See if you
can find Mrs. Curtis and Tom. There they are,
smiling at us from behind Eleanor and Lillian.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>Readers of &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Madge Morton</span>, <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Captain of the
&#8216;Merry Maid&#8217;</span>,&#8221; will remember the delightful
fashion in which Madge Morton, Eleanor Butler,
Lillian Seldon and Phyllis Alden spent a
summer on a houseboat, which they evolved
from an old canal boat and named the &#8220;Merry
Maid.&#8221;</p>
<p>How they anchored at quiet spots along
Chesapeake Bay, made the acquaintance of Mrs.
Curtis, a wealthy widow, and what came of the
friendship that sprang up between her and
Madge Morton made a story well worth the telling.</p>
<p>In &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Madge Morton&#8217;s Secret</span>&#8221; the scene of
their second houseboat adventure found them
at Old Point Comfort, where, as Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s
guests, they partook of the social side of the
Army and Navy life to be found there. The origin
of Captain Madge&#8217;s secret, and of how she
kept it in spite of the humiliation and sorrow
it entailed, the mysterious way in which the
&#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; slipped her cable and drifted
through heavy seas to a deserted island, where
her crew lived the lives of girl Crusoes for many
weeks, form a narrative of lively interest.</p>
<p>In &#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Madge Morton&#8217;s Trust</span>&#8221; the further adventures
of the &#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; were fully related.
For the sake of the trip the happy houseboat
girls saddled themselves with Miss Betsey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
Taylor, a crotchety spinster, who was troubled
with nerves, and who offered to pay liberally
for her passage on their cosy &#8220;Ship of
Dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s faith and unshakable trust in David
Brewster, a poor young man who did the work
on Tom Curtis&#8217;s yacht, which made the trip
with the &#8220;Merry Maid,&#8221; her championing of
David when suspicion pointed darkly toward
him as a thief, and her unswerving loyalty to
the unhappy youth until his innocence was
established, revealed the little captain in the
light of a staunch true comrade and doubly endeared
her to all her companions.</p>
<p>Madge heard Miss Matilda Tolliver announce
that the valedictory would be delivered by Miss
Madge Morton. Phyllis gave her companion a
little nudge, and somehow Madge arrived at the
front of the stage and stood under a huge arch
of flowers. Just above her head swung a great
bell. Everyone was smiling at her. Madge was
seized with a dreadful case of stage fright. Her
tongue felt dry and parched. She tried to
speak, but no sound came forth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s lovely face, with its crown of
soft, white hair, smiled encouragingly at her.
Tom was crimson with embarrassment. Lillian
and Eleanor held each other&#8217;s hands. Would
Madge never begin her valedictory?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>She tried again. No one heard her except her
friends and teachers on the stage. Her voice
was no louder than a faint whisper.</p>
<p>Miss Tolliver leaned over. &#8220;Madge, speak
more distinctly,&#8221; she ordered.</p>
<p>Then the little captain realized that the most
humiliating moment of her whole life had arrived.
She had been selected as the valedictorian
of her class, she had been chosen above her
beloved Phil because of her gift as a speaker,
yet she would be obliged to return to her seat
without having delivered a line of her address.
She would be disgraced forever!</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s knees shook. Her lips trembled.
Tears swam mistily in her eyes. She was a
lovely picture despite her fright.</p>
<p>At eighteen she was in the first glory of her
youth, a tall, slender girl, with a curious warmth
and glow of life. Her lips were deeply crimson,
her hair a soft brown, with red and gold lights
in it, and her eyes were full of the eagerness that
foreshadows both happiness and pain.</p>
<p>Phil and Miss Jenny Ann were exchanging
glances of despair&mdash;Madge had broken down,
there was no hope for her. Suddenly her
face broke into one of its sunniest smiles. She
lifted her head. Without glancing at the paper
she held in her hand she began her address in a
clear, penetrating voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>HOW IT WAS ALL ARRANGED</h3>
</div>

<p>Madge&#8217;s valedictory address was almost
over. She had spoken of
&#8220;Friendship,&#8221; what it meant to a
girl at school and what it must mean to a woman
when the larger and more important difficulties
come into her life. &#8220;Schoolgirl friendships are
of no small consequence,&#8221; declaimed Madge;
&#8220;the friendships made in youth are the truest,
after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil listened to her chum&#8217;s voice, her eyes
misty with tears. Only a half-hour before she
and her beloved Madge had come very near to
having the first real quarrel of their lives. Phil
turned her gaze from Madge to glance idly at
the arch of flowers above her friend&#8217;s head.
Phil supposed that she must be dizzy from the
heat of the room, or else that she could not see
distinctly because of her tears; the arch seemed
to be swaying lightly from side to side, as
though it were blown by the wind. Yet the room
was perfectly still. Phil looked again. She
must be wrong. The arch was built of a framework
of wood. It was heavy and she did not believe
it would easily topple down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>Madge was happily unconscious of the wobbling
arch. A few more lines and her speech
would be ended! There was unbroken silence in
the roomy chapel of the girls&#8217; school, where the
commencement exercises were being held. Suddenly
some one in the back part of the room
jumped to his feet. A hoarse voice shouted,
&#8220;Madge!&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge started in amazement. Her manuscript
dropped to the ground. Every face but
hers blanched with terror. The swaying arch
was now visible to other people besides Phil.
Tom leaped to his feet, but he was tightly wedged
in between rows of women. Phil Alden made
a forward spring just as the arch tumbled. She
was not in time to save Madge, but some one else
had saved her; for, before Phil could reach the
front of the stage, Madge&#8217;s name had been
called again. Although the voice was an unknown
one, Madge instinctively obeyed it. She
made a little movement, leaning out to see who
had summoned her, and the arch crashed down
just at her back.</p>
<p>The quick cry from the audience frightened
Madge, whose face was turned away from the
wreck. She swung around without discovering
her rescuer. Some one had fallen on the stage.
Phyllis Alden had reached her friend&#8217;s side, not
in time to save her, but to receive, herself, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
heavy blow from the great bell that was suspended
from the arch.</p>
<p>Madge dropped on the stage at Phil&#8217;s side,
forgetting her speech and the presence of strangers.</p>
<p>Miss Tolliver and Miss Jenny Ann lifted
Phyllis before Dr. Alden had had time to reach
the stage. There was a dark bruise over Phil&#8217;s
forehead. In a moment she opened her eyes and
smiled. &#8220;I am not a bit hurt, Miss Matilda; <i>do</i>
let the exercises go on,&#8221; she begged faintly.
&#8220;Let Madge and me go up to the front of the
stage and bow, Miss Matilda. Then I can show
people that I am all right. We must not spoil
our commencement in this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Matilda agreed to this, and Madge and
Phyllis went forward to the center of the stage.
A storm of applause greeted them. Madge and
Phil were a little overcome at the ovation.
Madge supposed that they were being applauded
because of Phil&#8217;s heroism, and Phil presumed
that the demonstration was meant for Madge&#8217;s
valedictory, therefore neither girl knew just
what to do.</p>
<p>It was then that Miss Matilda Tolliver came
forward. She was usually a very severe and imposing
looking person. Most of her pupils were
dreadfully afraid of her. But the accident that
had so nearly injured her two favorite graduates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
had completely upset her nerves. Instead
of making a formal speech, as she had planned
to do, she stepped between the two girls,
taking a hand of each. &#8220;I had meant to introduce
Miss Alden a little later on to our friends
at the commencement exercises,&#8221; announced
Miss Tolliver, &#8220;but I believe I would rather do
it now. I wish to state that, although Miss Morton
has delivered the valedictory, Miss Phyllis
Alden&#8217;s average during the four years she has
spent at my preparatory school has been equally
high. It was her wish that Miss Morton should
be chosen to deliver the valedictory. But Miss
Alden&#8217;s friends have another honor which they
wish to bestow upon her. She has been voted,
without her knowledge, the most popular girl in
my school. Her fellow students have asked me
to present her with this pin as a mark of their
affection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Matilda leaned over, and before Phil
could grasp what was happening had pinned
in the soft folds of her organdie gown the class
pin, which was usually an enameled shield with
a crown of laurel above it; but the center of
Phil&#8217;s shield was formed of small rubies and
the crown of tiny diamonds.</p>
<p>Phyllis turned scarlet with embarrassment,
but Madge&#8217;s eyes sparkled with delight. She
was no longer ashamed of having been chosen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
as valedictorian. In spite of herself, Phyllis
Alden was the star of their commencement.</p>
<p>It was not until the four girls were seated
with their dear ones about a round luncheon
table in the largest hotel in Harborpoint that
Madge suddenly recalled the stranger whose
warning cry had probably saved her from a serious
hurt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis and Tom were entertaining in
honor of Madge and Phyllis. There were no
other guests except the two houseboat girls,
Eleanor and Lillian, Dr. and Mrs. Alden, and
Mr. and Mrs. Butler.</p>
<p>Madge sat next to Tom Curtis, and during the
progress of the luncheon managed to say softly:
&#8220;Did you see who it was that called my name
so strangely this morning, Tom? I was so
frightened at having to deliver my valedictory
that when I heard that sudden shout, &#8216;Madge!&#8217;
I was too much confused to recognize the voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who it
was. I heard the voice but couldn&#8217;t discover its
owner. It must have been some one at the very
back of the room, for no one in the audience
seems to know who called out to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll never know,&#8221; sighed Madge.
&#8220;It is a real commencement day mystery, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom nodded smilingly. &#8220;By the way, Madge,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
where are the houseboat girls going to spend
the summer after you come to Madeleine&#8217;s wedding?&#8221;
he asked. &#8220;You must be tired after
your winter&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head soberly. &#8220;We are not
going to be on the houseboat this year,&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;Going to New York to be bridesmaids
is about as much as four girls can arrange.
We haven&#8217;t even dared to think of the
houseboat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; interposed Phyllis, who had heard
the remark and the reply, &#8220;but we don&#8217;t wish
our families to know. You see, Madge and I are
hoping and planning to go to college next winter,
so, of course, we can&#8217;t afford another summer
holiday,&#8221; she ended under her breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Phil?&#8221; inquired Dr. Alden
from the other end of the table.</p>
<p>Phil blushed. &#8220;Nothing important, Father,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then I must have been mistaken,&#8221; replied
Dr. Alden, &#8220;for I thought I caught the
magic word, &#8216;houseboat.&#8217; No one of you girls
has ever spoken of the &#8216;Merry Maid&#8217; as unimportant.&#8221;</p>
<p>A cloud instantaneously overspread five faces
about the luncheon table. Neither Mrs. Curtis
nor Dr. Alden realized that in mentioning the
houseboat they had forced the houseboat passengers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
to break a vow of silence. Only the day
before the five of them had met in Miss Jenny
Ann Jones&#8217;s room. There they had solemnly
pledged themselves that, since it was impossible
for them to have this year&#8217;s vacation aboard
the &#8220;Merry Maid,&#8221; they would bear the sorrow
in silence. This time there was no &#8220;Miss
Betsey&#8221; to pay the expenses of the trip. The
girls and Miss Jenny Ann hadn&#8217;t a dollar to
spare. The cost of going to Madeleine Curtis&#8217;s
New York wedding was appalling to all of the
girls except Lillian, whose parents were in affluent
circumstances. But, of course, Madeleine
was almost a houseboat girl herself. Readers of
the first houseboat story will recall how Madeleine&#8217;s
fiancé, Judge Hilliard, rescued Madge
and Phyllis from a serious situation and saved
Madeleine from a far worse plight than that in
which he found the two girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Curtis,&#8221; remarked Dr. Alden in the
midst of the mournful silence, &#8220;Mr. and Mrs.
Butler, my wife and I have just been talking
things over. We have decided that it would be a
good thing for our girls to spend several weeks
on board their houseboat. But, of course, if
they have decided differently&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a good thing that Mrs. Curtis was not
giving a formal luncheon. A united shriek of
delight suddenly arose from four throats.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Madge sprang from the table to hug her uncle,
Eleanor blew kisses to her mother from across
the room, Lillian clapped both hands, and Miss
Jenny Ann smiled rapturously.</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s face was the only serious one. &#8220;Are
you sure we can afford it, Father?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>Dr. Alden nodded convincingly. &#8220;For a few
weeks, certainly,&#8221; he returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we don&#8217;t need to worry about afterward,&#8221;
rejoined Madge. &#8220;And don&#8217;t you think,
girls, it will be perfectly great, so long as we
are going to Madeleine&#8217;s wedding in New York,
for us to spend this holiday at the seashore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where, Madge?&#8221; asked Lillian.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; answered Mrs. Curtis, &#8220;only,
not to-day. It is a secret. Here is our pineapple
lemonade. Let&#8217;s hope for the happiest of
holidays for the little captain and her crew
aboard the good ship &#8216;Merry Maid&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>TANIA, A PRINCESS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Madge, do you think there is any
chance that Tom won&#8217;t meet us?&#8221;
inquired Eleanor Butler nervously.
&#8220;I do wish we could have come on to New
York with Lillian, Phil, and Miss Jenny Ann instead
of making that visit to Baltimore. It
seems so funny that they have been in New York
two whole days before us. I suppose they have
seen Madeleine&#8217;s presents, and our bridesmaids&#8217;
dresses&mdash;and everything!&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor sighed as she leaned back luxuriously
in the chair of the Pullman coach, gazing
down the aisle at her fellow passengers.</p>
<p>Madge was occupied in staring very hard at
her reflection in the small mirror between her
seat and Eleanor&#8217;s. She had wrinkled her
small nose and was surreptitiously applying
powder to the tip end of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course Tom and the girls will meet us,
Eleanor,&#8221; she replied emphatically. &#8220;Tom
would expect us to be lost forever if we were to
be turned loose in New York by ourselves. Oh,
dear me, isn&#8217;t it too splendid that we are going
to be Madeleine&#8217;s bridesmaids? I wonder if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
we shall look very &#8216;country&#8217; before so many society
people?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we shall,&#8221; returned Eleanor
calmly. &#8220;You need not look at yourself again
in that mirror. You are very well satisfied with
yourself, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; teased Eleanor.</p>
<p>Madge blushed and laughed. &#8220;I <i>do</i> like our
clothes, Nellie,&#8221; she admitted candidly. &#8220;You
know perfectly well that we have never had
tailored suits before in our lives. You do
look too sweet in that pale gray, like a little
nun. That pink rose in your hat gives just the
touch of color you need. I am sure I don&#8217;t see
why you are so sure we shall seem countrified,&#8221;
ended Madge. She had liked her reflection in
the glass. She wore a light-weight blue serge
traveling suit without a wrinkle in it, a spotless
white linen waist, and her new hat was particularly
attractive. Her cheeks were becomingly
flushed and her eyes glowed with the excitement
of arriving for the first time in New York City.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are almost in Jersey City now, aren&#8217;t
we, Madge?&#8221; exclaimed Eleanor, making a leap
for her bag, which promptly tumbled out of
the rack above and fell directly on the head of
a young man who was walking down the aisle
of the car.</p>
<p>Madge giggled. Eleanor, however, was crimson
with mortification. The young man did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
appear to be pleased. The girls had a brief
glimpse of him. He had blue eyes and sandy
hair and was exceedingly tall. Eleanor&#8217;s bag
had knocked his glasses off and he was obliged
to stoop in search of them in the aisle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so sorry,&#8221; apologized Eleanor in
her soft, Southern voice, as she picked up the
glasses and restored them to their owner. &#8220;I
am glad they were not broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man paid not the slightest attention
to her apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry, Nellie,&#8221; advised Madge, &#8220;it is
nearly time for us to get off the train and your
hat is on crooked. Don&#8217;t be such a timid little
goose! You are actually trembling. Of course
Tom or some one will meet us, and if they don&#8217;t
I shall not be in the least frightened.&#8221; Madge
announced this grandly. &#8220;That whistle means
we are entering Jersey City. We will find Tom
waiting for us at the gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor obediently followed Madge out of
their coach. The little captain seemed older
and more self-confident since she had been
graduated at Miss Tolliver&#8217;s, but Nellie hoped
devoutly that her cousin would not become imbued
with the impression that she was really
grown-up. It would spoil their good times.</p>
<p>The two girls had never seen such a headlong
rush of people in their lives. They clung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
desperately to their bags when a porter attempted
to carry them. A man bumped violently
against Madge, but he made no effort to apologize
as he rushed on through the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw so many people in such a hurry
in my life,&#8221; declared Nellie pettishly. &#8220;They
behave as though they thought New York City
were on fire and they were all rushing to put
the fire out. I shall be glad when Tom takes
charge of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once through the great iron gates the girls
looked anxiously about for Tom, but saw no
trace of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Tom must have missed the
ferry,&#8221; declared Madge with pretended cheerfulness.
&#8220;We shall have to wait here for only
about ten minutes until the next ferry boat
comes across from New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>When fifteen minutes had passed and there
was still no sign of Tom, Madge began to feel
worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge, I am sure you have made some kind
of mistake,&#8221; argued Eleanor plaintively. &#8220;I
know Mrs. Curtis would not fail to have some
one here on time to meet us for anything in the
world. Perhaps Tom wrote for us to come
across the ferry, and that he would meet us on
the New York side. Where is his letter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in my trunk, Nellie,&#8221; replied Madge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
in a crestfallen manner. She was not nearly so
grown-up or so sure of herself as she had been
half an hour before. &#8220;I know it was silly in me
not to have brought Tom&#8217;s letter with me, but I
was so sure that I knew just what it said. Perhaps
we had better go on over to New York.
Let&#8217;s hurry. Perhaps that boat is just about to
start.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two young women hurried aboard the
boat, which left the dock a moment later, just
as a tall, fair-haired young man, accompanied
by two girls, hurried upon the scene. The young
man was Tom Curtis and the young women
were Phyllis Alden and Lillian Seldon.</p>
<p>In the meantime Madge and her cousin had
crossed the river and had landed on the New
York side. What was the dreadful roar and
rumble that met their ears? It sounded like an
earthquake, with the noise of frightened people
shrieking above it. After a horrified moment
it dawned on the two little strangers that this
was only the usual roar of New York, which
Tom Curtis had so often described to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any use of our staying here
very long, Eleanor,&#8221; declared Madge, feeling
a great wave of loneliness and fear sweep over
her. &#8220;An accident must have happened to
Tom&#8217;s automobile on his way to the train to
meet us. I am afraid we were foolish not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
have stayed at the Jersey City station. I am
sure Tom wrote he would meet us there. I
have behaved like a perfect goose. It is because
I boasted so much about not being frightened
and knowing what to do. But I <i>do</i> know
Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s address. We can take a cab and
drive up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eleanor would fall in with Madge&#8217;s plans to
a certain point; then she would strike. Now
she positively refused to get into a cab. Her
mother and father and Miss Jenny Ann had
warned her never to trust herself in a cab in a
strange city. New York was too terrifying!
Eleanor would search for Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s home
on foot, in a car, or a bus, but in a cab she
would not ride.</p>
<p>Madge was obliged to give in gracefully. A
policeman showed the girls to a Twenty-third
Street car. He explained that when they came
to the Third Avenue L they must get out of the
car and take the elevated train uptown, since
Madge had explained to him that Mrs. Curtis
lived on Seventieth Street between Madison and
Fifth Avenues.</p>
<p>There was only one point that the policeman
failed to make clear to Eleanor and Madge. He
neglected to tell them that elevated trains, as
well as other cars, travel both up and down New
York City, and the way to discover which way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
the &#8220;L&#8221; train is moving is to consult the signs
on the steps that lead up to the elevated road.
The policeman supposed that the two young
women would make this observation for themselves.
Of course, under ordinary circumstances,
Madge and Nellie would have been
more sensible, but they were frightened and
confused at the bare idea of being alone in New
York and consequently lost their heads, and
they dashed up the Third Avenue elevated steps
without looking for signs, settled themselves in
the train and were off, as they supposed, for
Seventieth Street.</p>
<p>They were too much interested in gazing into
upstairs windows, where hundreds of people
were at work in tiny, dark rooms, to pay much
attention to the first stops at stations that their
train made. They knew they were still some distance
from Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s. Madge was completely
fascinated at the spectacle of a fat,
frowsy woman holding a baby by its skirt on
the sill of a six-story tenement house. Just as
the car went by the baby made a leap toward the
train. Madge smothered her scream as the
woman jerked the child out of danger just in
time. Then it suddenly occurred to her that this
was hardly the kind of neighborhood in which to
find Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s house. The sign at the next
stop was a name and not a street number. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
could not be possible that she and Eleanor had
made another mistake!</p>
<p>Madge hurried back to the end of the car to
find the conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wish to get out at the nearest station to
Seventieth Street and Lexington Avenue,&#8221; she
declared timidly.</p>
<p>The man paid not the slightest attention to
her. Madge repeated her question in a somewhat
bolder tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t going to get off near Seventieth
Street for some time if you keep a-traveling
away from it,&#8221; retorted the conductor crossly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got on a downtown &#8216;L&#8217; &#8217;stead of an up.
Better change at the next station. You&#8217;ll find
an uptown train across the street,&#8221; the man
ended more kindly, seeing the look of consternation
on Madge&#8217;s white face.</p>
<p>The girls walked sadly down the elevated
steps, dragging their bags, which seemed to
grow heavier with every moment. They
found themselves in one of the downtown foreign
slums of New York City. It was a bright,
early summer afternoon. The streets were
swarming with grown people and children.
Pushcarts lined the sidewalks. On an opposite
corner a hand organ played an Italian song. In
front of it was a small open space, encircled by
a group of idle men and women. Before the organ
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
danced a little figure that Madge and Eleanor
stopped to watch. They forgot their own
bewilderment in gazing at the strange sight.
The dancer was a little girl about twelve years
old, as thin as a wraith. Her hair was black and
hung in straight, short locks to her shoulders.
Her eyes were so big and burned so brightly
that it was difficult to notice any other feature
of her face. The child looked like a tropical
flower. Her face was white, but her cheeks glowed
with two scarlet patches. She flung her little
arms over her head, pirouetted and stood on her
tip toes. She did not seem to see the curious
crowd about her, but kept her eyes turned toward
the sky. Her dancing was as much a part
of nature as the summer sunshine, and Madge
and Eleanor were bewitched.</p>
<p>A rough woman came out of a nearby doorway.
She stood with her hands on her hips
looking in the direction of the music. &#8220;Tania!&#8221;
she called angrily. Elbowing her way through
the crowd, she jostled Madge as she passed by
her. &#8220;Tania!&#8221; she cried again. The men and
women spectators let the woman make her way
through them as though they knew her and were
afraid of her heavy fist. Only the child appeared
to be unconscious of the woman&#8217;s approach.
Suddenly a big, red arm was thrust out. It
caught the little girl by the skirt. With the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
other hand she rained down blows on the child&#8217;s
upturned face. One blow followed the other in
swift succession. The little dancer made no
outcry. She simply put one thin arm over her
head for protection.</p>
<p>The music went on gayly. No one of the
watching men and women tried to stop the woman&#8217;s
brutality. But Madge was not used to
the indifference of the New York crowd. Like
a flash of lightning she darted away from Eleanor
and rushed over to the woman, who was
dragging the child along and cuffing her at each
step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop striking that child!&#8221; she ordered
sharply. &#8220;How can you be so cruel? You are a
wicked, heartless woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman paid no attention to Madge. She
did not seem even to have heard her, but lifted
her big, coarse arm for another blow.</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s breath came in swift gasps. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
strike that child again,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know who she is, nor what she has done, but she
is too little for you to beat her like that. I won&#8217;t
endure it,&#8221; the little captain ended in sudden
passion.</p>
<p>The woman turned her cruel, bloodshot eyes
slowly toward Madge. She was one of the
strongest and most brutal characters in the
slums of New York, and few dared to oppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
her. She was even a terror to the policemen in
the neighborhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out!&#8221; she said briefly.</p>
<p>Her arm descended. It did not strike the
child. Quick as a flash, Madge Morton had
flung herself between the woman and the child.
For a moment the blow almost stunned the girl.
The East Side crowd closed in on the girl and
the woman. If there was going to be a fight, the
spectators did not intend to miss it. Eleanor
was numb with fear and sympathy. She did
not know whether to be more frightened for
Madge than sorry for the child.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face was mottled and crimson
with anger. Madge&#8217;s face was very white. She
held her head high and looked her enemy full
in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git out of this and stop your interferin&#8217;!&#8221;
shouted the virago. &#8220;This here child belongs
to me and I&#8217;ll do what I like with her. If you
are one of them social settlers coming around
into poor people&#8217;s places and meddlin&#8217; with
their business, you&#8217;d better git back where you
belong or I&#8217;ll social-settle you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment a thin, hot hand caught hold
of Madge&#8217;s and pulled it gently. Madge gazed
down into a little face, whose expression she
never forgot. It was whiter than it had been
before. The scarlet color had gone out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
cheeks and the big, black eyes burned brighter.
But there was not the slightest trace of fear in
the look. Instead, the child&#8217;s lips were curved
into an elf-like smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stay here, lady, please,&#8221; she begged.
&#8220;The ogress will be horrid to you. She can&#8217;t
hurt me. You see, I am an enchanted Princess.&#8221;</p>
<p>An instant later the child received a savage
blow from the woman&#8217;s hard hand full in the
face without shrinking. It was Madge who
winced. Tears rose to her eyes. She put her
arms about the child and tried to shelter her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be calling me no names, Tania,&#8221; the
woman cried, dragging at the child&#8217;s thin skirts.
&#8220;Jest you come along home with me and you&#8217;ll
git what is comin&#8217; to you, you good-for-nothin&#8217;
little imp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she your mother?&#8221; asked Madge doubtfully,
gazing at the brutal woman and the
strange child.</p>
<p>Tania shook her black head scornfully. &#8220;Oh,
dear, no,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It is only that I
have to live with her now, while I am under the
enchantment. Some day, when the wicked spell
is broken, I shall go away, perhaps to a wonderful
castle. My name is Titania. I think it
means that I am the Queen of the Fairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman laughed brutishly. &#8220;Queen of
gutter, you are, Miss Tania. I&#8217;ll tan you,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
she jeered, as she dragged the little girl from
Madge&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>The little captain looked despairingly about
her. There, a calm witness of the entire scene,
was a big New York policeman. &#8220;Officer,&#8221; commanded
Madge indignantly, &#8220;make that woman
leave that child alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big policeman looked sheepish. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
do nothing with Sal,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;If I make
her stop beating Tania now, she&#8217;ll only be
meaner to her when she gets her indoors. Best
leave &#8217;em alone, I think. I have interfered, but
the child says she don&#8217;t mind. I don&#8217;t think she
does, somehow; she&#8217;s such a queer young &#8217;un&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sal was now engaged in shaking Tania as she
pushed her along in front of her. Madge and
Eleanor were in despair.</p>
<p>Suddenly a well-dressed young man appeared
in the crowd. There was something oddly familiar
in his appearance to Eleanor, but she
failed to remember where she had seen him before.
&#8220;Sal!&#8221; he called out sharply, &#8220;leave
Tania alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Instantly the woman obeyed him. She slunk
back into her open doorway. The crowd melted
as though by magic; they also recognized the
young man&#8217;s authority. A moment later he
was gone. Madge, Eleanor, and the strange little
girl stood on the street corner almost alone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE UNINVITED GUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Are you good fairies who have strayed
away from home?&#8221; inquired Tania,
calmly gazing first at Madge and then
at Eleanor. She was perfectly self-possessed
and asked her question as though it were the
most natural one in the world.</p>
<p>The two girls stared hard at the child. Was
her mind affected, or was she playing a game
with them? Tania seemed not in the least disturbed.
&#8220;Do go away now,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;I
am all right, but something may happen to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You odd little thing!&#8221; laughed Madge. &#8220;We
are not fairies. We are girls and we are lost.
We are on our way to visit a friend, Mrs. Curtis,
who lives on Seventieth Street near Fifth
Avenue. She will be dreadfully worried about
us if we don&#8217;t hurry on. But what can we do
for you? We can&#8217;t take you with us, yet you
must not go back to that wicked woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I must,&#8221; returned Tania cheerfully.
&#8220;I am not afraid of her. When the time
comes I shall go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who will take care of you, baby?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Eleanor. &#8220;Fairies don&#8217;t live in big cities like
New York. They live only in beautiful green
woods and fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black head nodded wisely. &#8220;Good fairies
are everywhere,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;But I can
make handfuls of pennies when I like,&#8221; she continued
boastfully. &#8220;Let me show you how you
must go on your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t possibly know, little girl,&#8221; replied
Madge gently. &#8220;It is so far from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, it was Tania who finally saw the
two lost houseboat girls on board the elevated
train that would take them to within a few
blocks of their destination. Tania explained
that she knew almost all of New York, and particularly
she liked to wander up and down Fifth
Avenue to gaze at the beautiful palaces. She
was not young, she was really dreadfully old&mdash;almost
thirteen!</p>
<p>The last look Madge and Eleanor had of
Tania the child had apparently forgotten all
about them. She was gazing up in the air, above
all the traffic and roar of New York, with a
happy smile on her elfish face.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;My dear children, I wouldn&#8217;t have had it
happen for worlds!&#8221; was Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
greeting as she came out from behind the rose-colored
curtains of her drawing room. &#8220;Tom
has been telephoning me frantically for the past
hour. How did he and the girls miss you? You
poor dears, you must be nearly tired to death
after your unpleasant experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Mrs. Curtis was talking she was leading
her visitors up a beautiful carved oak staircase
to the floor above. Her house was so handsomely
furnished that Madge and Eleanor were
startled at its luxurious appointments.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis brought her guests into a large
sleeping room which opened into another
bedroom which was for the use of Phil and Lillian.</p>
<p>Madeleine was to be married the next afternoon
at four o &#8217;clock. The girls had not brought
their bridesmaids&#8217; dresses along with them, as
Mrs. Curtis had asked to be allowed to present
them with their gowns.</p>
<p>It was all that Madge could do not to beg Mrs.
Curtis to show them their frocks. She hoped
that their hostess would offer to do so, but during
the rest of the day their time was occupied
in seeing Madeleine, her hundreds of beautiful
wedding gifts, meeting Judge Hilliard all over
again, and being introduced to Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s
other guests. The four girls went to bed at
midnight, thinking of their bridesmaids&#8217; gowns,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
but without having had the chance even to inquire
about them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis belonged to the old and infinitely
more aristocratic portion of New York society.
She did not belong to the new smart set, which
numbers nearer four thousand, and does so
much to make society ridiculous. Madeleine
had asked that she might be married very
quietly. She had never become used to the gay
world of fashion after her strange and unhappy
youth. It made the girls and their teacher smile
to see what Mrs. Curtis considered a quiet wedding.</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann and her four charges had
their coffee and rolls in Madge&#8217;s room the next
morning at about nine o&#8217;clock. Madge peeped
out of the doorway, there were so many odd
noises in the hall. The upstairs hall was a mass
of beautiful evergreens. Men were hanging
garlands of smilax on the balusters. The house
was heavy with the scent of American Beauty
roses. But there was no sign of Mrs. Curtis or
of Madeleine or Tom, and still no mention of
the bridesmaids&#8217; costumes for the girls.</p>
<p>Lillian Seldon was looking extremely forlorn.
&#8220;Suppose Mrs. Curtis has forgotten our
frocks!&#8221; she suggested tragically, as Madge
came back with her report of the house&#8217;s decorations.
&#8220;She has had such an awful lot to attend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
to that she may not have remembered that
she offered to give us our frocks. Won&#8217;t it be
dreadful if Madeleine has to be married without
our being bridesmaids after all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Lillian! what a dreadful idea!&#8221; exclaimed
Eleanor.</p>
<p>Even Phyllis looked sober and Miss Jenny
Ann looked exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&#8220;O, you geese! cheer up!&#8221; laughed Madge.
&#8220;I know Mrs. Curtis would not disappoint us
for worlds. Why, she has all our measures. She
couldn&#8217;t forget. Oh, dear, does my breakfast
gown look all right? There is some one knocking
at our door. It may be that Mrs. Curtis has
sent up our frocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then open the door, for goodness&#8217; sake,&#8221;
begged Eleanor. &#8220;Your breakfast gown is
lovely; only at home we called it a wrapper,
but then you were not visiting on Fifth Avenue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge made a saucy little face at Eleanor.
Then she saw a group of persons standing just
outside their bedroom door. A man-servant
held four enormous white boxes in his arms; a
maid was almost obscured by four other boxes
equally large. Behind her servants stood Mrs.
Curtis, smiling radiantly, while Tom was peeping
over his mother&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Madge clasped her hands fervently, breathing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
a quick sigh of relief. &#8220;Our bridesmaids&#8217;
dresses! I&#8217;m too delighted for words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you thinking about them, dear?&#8221;
apologized Mrs. Curtis. &#8220;I ought to have sent
the frocks to you sooner, but I wanted to bring
them myself, and this is the first moment I have
had. You&#8217;ll let Tom come in to see them, too,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man-servant departed, but Mrs. Curtis
kept the maid to help her lift out the gowns from
the billows of white tissue paper that enfolded
them. She lifted out one dress, Miss Jenny Ann
another, and the maid the other two.</p>
<p>The girls were speechless with pleasure.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis, however, was disappointed. Perhaps
the girls did not like the costumes. She
had used her own taste without consulting them.
Then she glanced at the little group and was reassured
by their radiant faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;O you wonderful fairy godmother!&#8221; exclaimed
Madge. &#8220;Cinderella&#8217;s dress at the ball
couldn&#8217;t have been half so lovely!&#8221;</p>
<p>Madeleine&#8217;s wedding was to be in white and
green. The bridesmaids&#8217; frocks were of the
palest green silk, covered with clouds of white
chiffon. About the bottom of the skirts were
bands of pale green satin and the chiffon was
caught here and there with embroidered
wreaths of lilies of the valley. The hats were of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
white chip, ornamented with white and pale
green plumes.</p>
<p>It was small wonder that four young girls,
three of them poor, should have been awestruck
at the thought of appearing in such
gowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall save mine for my own wedding
dress!&#8221; exclaimed Eleanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall make my début in mine,&#8221; insisted
Lillian.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t thank you enough,&#8221; declared
Phyllis, a little overcome by so much grandeur.</p>
<p>Tom was standing in a far corner of the
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to suggest that I be allowed to
come into this,&#8221; he demanded firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Tom?&#8221; teased Madge. &#8220;You&#8217;re
merely the audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom took four small square boxes out of his
pocket. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you be too sure, Miss Madge
Morton. My future brother-in-law, Judge Robert
Hilliard, has commissioned me to present
his gifts to his bridesmaids. Madge shall be the
last person to see in these boxes, just for her
unkind treatment of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Tom,&#8221; agreed Madge; &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think I could stand anything more just at this
instant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Madge peeped over Phil&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
shoulder. Judge Hilliard had presented each
one of the houseboat girls with an exquisite little
pin, an enameled model of their houseboat,
done in white and blue, the colors of the &#8220;Merry
Maid.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The wedding was over. There were still a
few guests in the dining room saying good-bye
to Mrs. Curtis and Tom; but Madeleine and
Judge Hilliard had gone. The four girls and
Miss Jenny Ann found a resting place in the
beautiful French music room.</p>
<p>Madeleine&#8217;s wedding presents were in the library,
just behind the music room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was simply perfect, wasn&#8217;t it, Miss Jenny
Ann?&#8221; breathed Lillian, as they drew their
chairs together for a talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madeleine must be perfectly happy,&#8221; sighed
Eleanor sentimentally. &#8220;Judge Hilliard is so
good-looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear me!&#8221; broke in Madge, coming out
of a brown study. She was sitting in a big
carved French chair. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how Madeleine
Curtis could have left her mother and this
beautiful home for any man in the world. I am
sure if I had such an own mother I should never
leave her,&#8221; finished the little captain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Until some one came along whom you loved
better,&#8221; interposed Miss Jenny Ann.</p>
<p>&#8220;That could never be, Miss Jenny Ann,&#8221; declared
Madge stoutly, her blue eyes wistful.
&#8220;Why, if my father is alive and I find him, I
shall never leave him for anybody else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that noise?&#8221; demanded Phyllis
sharply.</p>
<p>It was after six o&#8217;clock and the Curtis home
was brilliantly lighted. The window blinds
were all closed. But there was a curious rapping
and scratching at one of the windows that
opened into a small side yard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be one of the servants,&#8221; suggested
Miss Jenny Ann, listening intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be,&#8221; rejoined Madge. &#8220;No one of
them would make such a strange noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I had better call Tom,&#8221; breathed Eleanor
faintly. &#8220;It must be a burglar trying to
steal Madeleine&#8217;s wedding gifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head. &#8220;Wait, please,&#8221; she
whispered. She ran to the window. There was
the faint scratching noise again! Madge lifted
the shade quickly. Perched on the window sill
was the oddest figure that ever stepped out of
the pages of a fairy book. It was impossible to
see just what it was, yet it looked like a little
girl. One hand clung to the window facing, a
small nose pressed against the pane.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a child!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Jenny
Ann in tones of relief. &#8220;Open the window and
let her come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge flung open the window. Light as a
thistledown, the unexpected little visitor landed
in the center of the room.</p>
<p>Madge and Eleanor had completely forgotten
the elfin child they had met in the slums of New
York City; but now she appeared among them
just as mysteriously as though she were the
fairy she pretended to be.</p>
<p>She wore a small red coat that was half a dozen
sizes too tiny for her. Her skirt was patched
with odds and ends of bright flowered materials.
On her head perched a cap, a scarlet flower, cut
from an odd scrap of old wall paper. In her
hands Tania clasped a ridiculous bundle, done
up in a dirty handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;You strange little witch!&#8221; exclaimed
Madge. &#8220;However did you find your way here?
Be very still and good until the lovely lady who
owns this house sees you, then I wouldn&#8217;t be at
all surprised if she gave you some cake and ice
cream before she sends you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tania sat down in the corner still as a mouse.
Her thin knees were hunched close together.
She held her poor bundle tightly. Her big black
eyes grew larger and darker with wonder as she
had her first glimpse of a fairyland, outside her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
own imagination, in the beautiful room and the
group of lovely girls who occupied it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis came in a minute later, followed
by a man who had been one of the guests at the
wedding. Madge, Eleanor, and Tania recognized
him instantly. He was the young man who
had protected Tania from the blows of the brutal
woman the afternoon before, but Tania did
not seem pleased to see him. Her face flushed
hotly, her lips quivered, though she made no
sound.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis smiled quizzically. Madge could
see that there were tears behind her smiles.
&#8220;Who is our latest guest, Madge?&#8221; she asked,
gazing kindly at the odd little person.</p>
<p>Tania rose gravely from her place on the
floor. &#8220;I am a fairy who has been under the
spell of a wicked witch,&#8221; she asserted with solemnity,
&#8220;but now the spell is broken and I&#8217;ve
run away from her. I shan&#8217;t go back ever any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s young man guest took the child
firmly by the shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by coming here to trouble
these young ladies?&#8221; he demanded sternly. &#8220;I
thought I recognized your friends, Mrs. Curtis.
They saved this child yesterday from a punishment
she probably well deserved. She is one of
the children in our slum neighborhood that we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
have not been able to reach. I will take her
back to her home with me at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s head was high in the air. She
caught her breath. Her eyes had a queer, eerie
look in them. &#8220;You can&#8217;t take me back now,&#8221;
she insisted. &#8220;The spell is broken. I shall
never see old Sal again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge put her arm about the small witch girl.
&#8220;Let her stay here just to-night, Mrs. Curtis,
please,&#8221; begged Madge earnestly. &#8220;I wish to
find out something about her. I will look after
her and see that she does not do any harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quite seriously and gently Tania knelt on one
knee and kissed Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Let me
stay. I shall be on my way again in the morning,&#8221;
she pleaded, &#8220;but I am a little afraid of
the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear child,&#8221; said Mrs. Curtis, gently
drawing the waif to her side, &#8220;you are far too
little to be running away from home. You may
stay here to-night, then to-morrow we will see
what we can do for you. I won&#8217;t trouble you
with her to-night, Philip,&#8221; she added, turning
to her guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be no trouble,&#8221; returned Philip Holt
blandly. &#8220;She lives less than an hour&#8217;s ride
from here. Her foster mother will be greatly
worried at her absence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis looked hesitatingly at Tania, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
had been listening with alert ears. The child&#8217;s
black eyes took on a look of lively terror.
&#8220;Please, please let me stay,&#8221; she begged, clasping
her thin little hands in anxious appeal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let Tania stay here to-night,
Mrs. Curtis?&#8221; asked Madge for the second
time. &#8220;I am sorry to disagree with Mr. Holt,
but I do not believe that poor little Tania is
either lawless or incorrigible. The woman who
claims her is the most cruel, brutal-looking person
I ever saw. I am sure she is not Tania&#8217;s
mother. Let me keep her here to-night, and to-morrow
I will inquire into her case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, Madge,&#8221; said Mrs. Curtis reluctantly.
She glanced toward Philip Holt. His
eyes, however, were fixed upon Madge with an
expression of disapproval and dislike. For the
first time it occurred to Mrs. Curtis that Philip
Holt might be very disagreeable if thwarted.
She immediately dismissed the thought as unworthy
when the young man said smoothly: &#8220;I
shall be only too glad to have Miss Morton investigate
the child&#8217;s record. I am sorry that
my word has not been sufficient to convince
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge made no reply to this thrust. Then an
awkward silence ensued. Mrs. Curtis looked
annoyed, Tania triumphant, Madge belligerent,
and the other girls sympathetic. Making a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
strong effort, Philip Holt controlled his anger
and, extending his hand to Mrs. Curtis, said:
&#8220;Pray, pardon my interference. I was prompted
to speak merely in your interest. I trust I
shall see you again in the near future. Good
night.&#8221; He bowed coldly to the young women
and took his departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a disagreeable&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Madge stopped
abruptly. Her face flushed. &#8220;I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Curtis,&#8221; she said contritely. &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t have spoken my mind aloud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgive you, my dear,&#8221; there was a
slight tone of constraint in Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s voice,
&#8220;but I am sure if you knew Mr. Holt as I do
you would have an entirely different opinion of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should,&#8221; returned Madge politely,
but in her heart she knew that she and
Philip Holt were destined not to be friends, but
bitter enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>TANIA, A PROBLEM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it would be a splendid
plan for Tania?&#8221; asked Madge
eagerly. &#8220;Miss Jenny Ann and the
girls are willing she should come to us. Tania
is such a fascinating little person, with her
dreams and her pretences, that she is the best
kind of company. Besides, I am awfully sorry
for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis and Madge were seated in the latter&#8217;s
bedroom indulging in one of their old-time
confidential talks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tania would be a great deal of care for you,
Madge,&#8221; argued Mrs. Curtis. &#8220;She is worrying
my maids almost distracted with her foolishness.
Last night she wrapped herself in a
sheet and frightened poor Norah almost to death
by dancing in the moonlight. She explained to
Norah that she was pretending that she was a
moonflower swaying in the wind. I wonder
where the child got such odd fancies and bits of
information? She has never seen a moonflower
in her life.&#8221; Mrs. Curtis laughed and frowned
at the same time. &#8220;Poor little daughter of the
tenements! She is indeed a problem.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you all I have been able to find
out about Tania?&#8221; asked Madge. &#8220;Her history
is quite like a story-book tale. I think her father
and mother were actors, but the father died
when Tania was only a little baby. That is why,
I suppose, they called the child by such an absurd
name as &#8216;Titania.&#8217; I looked it up and it
comes from Shakespeare&#8217;s play of &#8216;Midsummer
Night&#8217;s Dream.&#8217; I think perhaps her mother
was just a dancer, or had only a small part in
the plays in which she appeared, for they never
had any money. Tania has lived in a tenement
always. The mother used to take care of her
baby when she could, and then leave her to the
neighbors. But the mother must have been unusual,
too, for she taught Tania all sorts of
poetry and music when Tania was only a tiny
child. Indeed, Tania knows a great deal more
about literature than I do now,&#8221; confessed
Madge honestly. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t so strange, after all,
that Tania pretends. Why, she and her mother
used to play at pretending together. When they
sat down to their dinner they used to rub their
old lamp and play that it was Aladdin&#8217;s wonderful
lamp, and that their poor table was spread
with a wonderful feast, instead of just bread
and cheese. They tried to make light of their
poverty.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s eyes were full of tears. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
could understand better than Madge the scene
the young girl pictured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tania was eight years old when her mother
died,&#8221; finished Madge pensively. &#8220;Since then
poor Tania has had such a dreadful time, living
with that wretched old Sal, who has made a
regular slavey of her, and she just had to
go on with her pretending in order to be able to
bear her life at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge and Mrs. Curtis were both silent for a
moment. The bright June sunshine flooded the
room, offering a sharp contrast to Tania&#8217;s sad
little story.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see why I wish to take her on the houseboat,&#8221;
pleaded Madge. &#8220;It seems so wonderful
that we are going to Cape May and will be
on the really seashore, near you and Tom, that
each one of us feels the desire to do something
for somebody just to show how happy we are.
Miss Jenny Ann says we may take Tania, if you
think it wouldn&#8217;t be unwise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to go to school, Madge,&#8221; argued
Mrs. Curtis half-heartedly. &#8220;Tania does not
know any of the things she should. Philip Holt,
who does so much good work among the poor in
Tania&#8217;s tenement district, says that the child is
most unreliable and does not tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge wrinkled her nose with the familiar expression
she wore when annoyed. Her investigations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
had proved Philip Holt a liar, but she
refrained from saying so.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like Philip, do you?&#8221; continued
Mrs. Curtis. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair to have prejudices
without reason. Mr. Holt is a fine young man
and does splendid work among the poor. Madeleine
and I have entrusted him with the most of
the money we have given to charity. I am sorry
that you girls don&#8217;t like him, because he is coming
to visit me at Cape May this summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge dutifully stifled her vague feeling of
regret. &#8220;Of course, we will try to like him, if
he is your friend,&#8221; she replied loyally. &#8220;It was
only that we thought Mr. Holt had a terribly superior
manner for such a young man, and looked
too &#8216;goody-goody&#8217;! But you have not answered
me yet about Tania. Do let us have
Tania. I&#8217;ll teach her lots of things this summer,
and it won&#8217;t be so hard for her when she
goes to school in the fall. She is pretty good
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; consented Mrs. Curtis reluctantly,
&#8220;for this summer only. The child will
get you into difficulties, but I suppose they
won&#8217;t be serious. What is Madge Morton going
to do next fall? Is she going to college with
Phil, or is she coming to be my daughter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge lowered her red-brown head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know, dear,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;You know I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
said all along to Uncle and Aunt that, just as
soon as I was grown up, I was going to start out
to find my father. I shall be nineteen next winter.
It surely is time for me to begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Madge, dear, you can&#8217;t find your father
unless you know where to look for him. The
world is a very large place! I am sorry&#8221;&mdash;Mrs.
Curtis smoothed Madge&#8217;s soft hair tenderly&mdash;&#8220;but
I agree with your uncle and aunt; your
father must be dead. Were he alive he would
surely have tried to find his little daughter long
before this. Your uncle and aunt have never
heard from or of him during all these years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t feel sure that he is dead,&#8221; returned
Madge thoughtfully. &#8220;You see, my father disappeared
after his court-martial in the Navy.
He never dreamed that some day his superior
officer would confess his own guilt and declare
Father innocent. I can&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t, believe he is
dead. Somewhere in this world he lives and
some day I shall find him, I am sure of it. Phil,
Lillian and Eleanor have all pledged themselves
to my cause, too,&#8221; she added, smiling faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do all that I can to help you, Madge.
Just have a good time this summer, and in the
autumn, perhaps, there may be some information
for you to work on. What is that dreadful
noise? I never heard anything like it in my
house before!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Curtis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>Madge sprang to her feet. There was the
sound of a heavy fall in the next room, a scream,
then a discreet knock on Madge&#8217;s door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; commanded Mrs. Curtis.</p>
<p>The door opened and the butler appeared in
the doorway, his solemn, red face redder and
more solemn than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, it&#8217;s that child again,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;While the young ladies was out in the automobile
with Mr. Tom, she went in their room, emptied
out one of their trunks and shut herself inside.
She said she was &#8216;Hope&#8217; and the trunk
was &#8216;Pandory&#8217;s Box,&#8217; or some such crazy foolishness.
She meant to jump out when the young
ladies came back, but Norah went into the room
with some clean towels, and when the little one
bobs her head out of that box, just like a black
witch, poor Norah is scared out of her wits and
drops on the floor all of a heap. If that child
doesn&#8217;t go away from here soon, Ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t
know how we can ever bear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do, Richards,&#8221; answered Mrs.
Curtis coldly. But Madge could see that she
was dreadfully vexed at Tania&#8217;s latest naughtiness.</p>
<p>The little captain gave Mrs. Curtis a penitent
hug. &#8220;It is all my fault, dear. I should never
have brought the little witch here,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and make it all right with Norah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
and see that Tania does no more mischief&mdash;for
a while, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis looked somewhat mollified, nevertheless,
she was far from pleased, and Madge&#8217;s
championship of little Tania was to cause the
little captain more than one unhappy hour.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A MISCHIEVOUS MERMAID</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a splash over the side of a
boat, then another, one more, and a
fourth. The water rippled and broke
away into smooth curves. Down a long streak
of moonlight four dark objects floated above
the surface of the waves. For a few seconds
there was not a sound, not even a shout, to show
that the mermaids were at play.</p>
<p>Two dark heads kept in advance of the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge,&#8221; warned a voice, &#8220;we must not go
too far out. Remember, we promised Jenny
Ann. My, but isn&#8217;t this water glorious! I feel
as though I could swim on forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>A graceful figure turned over and the moonlight
shone full on a happy face. The two
swimmers moved along more slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nellie, Lillian!&#8221; Madge called back, &#8220;are
you all right? Do you wish to go on farther?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil and Madge floated quietly until their two
friends caught up with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as though I could go on all night at
this rate,&#8221; declared Lillian Seldon. Eleanor
put her hand out. &#8220;May I float along with you
a little, Madge?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I am tired. How
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
wide and empty the ocean looks to-night! We
must not get out of sight of the lights of the
&#8216;Merry Maid&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no danger!&#8221; scoffed Madge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; cried Phil Alden sharply. She
was swimming ahead. She saw first the sails of
a small yacht making across the bay with all
speed to the line of the shore that the girls had
just quitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s follow the boat back home,&#8221; suggested
Madge. &#8220;We can keep far enough away for
them not to see us. It will be rather good fun
if they take us for porpoises or mermaids, or
any other queer sea creature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t run into that Noah&#8217;s ark that we saw
anchored in the creek this morning, Roy,&#8221; came
a shrill voice from the deck of the yacht. &#8220;I
saw half a dozen women going aboard her this
afternoon laden with boxes and trunks&mdash;everything
but the parrot and the monkey. It looked
as though they meant to spend the summer
aboard her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they do, Mabel,&#8221; a man&#8217;s voice answered.
&#8220;The &#8216;Noah&#8217;s Ark&#8217; is a houseboat. It
looked very tiny for so many people, but I
thought it was rather pretty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we have girls enough at Cape May this
summer&mdash;about six to every man,&#8221; argued Mabel
crossly. &#8220;I vote that we give these new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
persons the cold shoulder. Nobody knows who
they are, nor where they come from. It is bad
enough to have to associate with tiresome hotel
visitors, but I shall draw the line at these water-rats,
and I hope you will do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She means us,&#8221; gasped Eleanor. &#8220;What a
perfectly horrid girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>The high, sharp voice on the yacht was distinctly
audible over the water. The boat had
slowed down as it drew nearer to the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swim along with Phil, Nellie,&#8221; proposed
Madge. &#8220;I am going to have some fun with
those young persons. I don&#8217;t care if I <i>am</i>
nearly grown-up; I am not going to miss a lark
when there&#8217;s a chance. I have that rubber ball
that Phil and I brought out to play with in the
water. Watch me throw it on their yacht.
They&#8217;ll think it&#8217;s a bomb, or a meteor, if I can
throw straight enough. I am going to settle
with them this very minute for the disagreeable
things they just said about us and our pretty
&#8216;Merry Maid.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it, Madge!&#8221; expostulated Phil; but
she was too late; Madge had dived and was
swimming along almost completely under the
water. She swam in the darkness cast by the
shadow of the boat as it passed within a few
yards of them.</p>
<p>Like a flash she lifted her great rubber ball.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
She had better luck than she deserved. The
ball came out of nowhere and landed in the center
of the group of three young people on the
yacht. It fell first on the deck, and then bounced
into the lap of the offending Mabel.</p>
<p>It was hard work for the waiting girls not to
laugh aloud as naughty Madge came slowly
back to them.</p>
<p>A wild shriek went up from on board the
yacht. &#8220;Oh, dear, what was that?&#8221; one girl
asked faintly, when the first cries of alarm had
died away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it? What was it?&#8221; growled a masculine
voice. &#8220;Are you really hurt, Mabel?
You are making so much fuss that I can&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mabel had dropped back in a chair. She was
white with fear and trembling violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is in my lap,&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;It may explode
any moment&mdash;do take it away!&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the yacht, Roy Dennis, turned a
small electric flashlight full on his two girl
guests. There, in Mabel&#8217;s lap, was surely a
round, globular-shaped object that had either
dropped from the sky or had been thrown at
them by an unknown hand. Roy had really no
desire to pick it up without seeing it more
clearly.</p>
<p>The other girl was less timid. She reached
over and took hold of Madge&#8217;s ball. Then she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
laughed aloud. Oddly enough, her laugh was
repeated out on the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s only a rubber ball!&#8221; she asserted.
Ethel Swann, who was one of the old-time cottagers
at Cape May, ran to the side of the boat.
&#8220;See!&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;over there are some
boys swimming. I suppose they threw the ball
on board just to frighten us. They certainly
were successful.&#8221; She hurled Madge&#8217;s ball
back over the water, but Roy Dennis&#8217;s small
yacht had gone some distance from the group
of mischievous mermaids and he did not turn
back. &#8220;If I find out who did that trick, I surely
will get even with them,&#8221; muttered Roy. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like to be made a fool of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Jenny Ann, please, girls,&#8221; begged
Madge, as the four girls clambered aboard
the &#8220;Merry Maid.&#8221; &#8220;It was a very silly trick
that I played. I should hate to have the cottagers
at the Cape hear of it. I don&#8217;t suppose I
shall ever grow up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, whatever made you stay in the water
so long?&#8221; demanded Miss Jenny Ann, coming
into the girls&#8217; stateroom with a big pitcher of
hot chocolate and a plate of cakes. &#8220;I have been
uneasy about you. You have been in the water
for half an hour. That&#8217;s too long for a first
swim. Poor Tania is fast asleep. The child is
utterly worn out with so much excitement. Think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
of never having been out of a crowded city in her
life, and then seeing this wonderful Cape May!
Tania wanted to stay up to wish you good night.
I left her staring out of the cabin window at the
stars when I went into our kitchen to make the
chocolate. When I came back she was asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Jenny Ann,&#8221; said Madge penitently,
pulling their chaperon down on the berth beside
her, while Lillian poured the chocolate, &#8220;it was
my fault we were late. The bad things are always
my fault. But we are going to have a perfectly
glorious time this summer, aren&#8217;t we?
Just think, next year Phil and I shall be nineteen
and nearly old ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if anything special is going to happen
to us this holiday?&#8221; pondered Phil, crunching
away on her third cake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something special always does happen to
us,&#8221; declared Lillian. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to bed now,
because, if we are going to row up the bay in the
morning to explore the shore, we shall have to
get up early to put the &#8216;Merry Maid&#8217; in order.
We must be regular old Cape May inhabitants
by the time that Mrs. Curtis and Tom arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next morning bad news came to the crew of
the little houseboat. Mrs. Curtis had been called
to Chicago by the illness of her brother, and
Tom had gone with her. They did not know
how soon they would be able to come on to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
Cape May; but within a very few days Philip
Holt, the goody-goody young man who was one
of Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s special favorites, would come
on to Cape May, and Mrs. Curtis hoped that the
girls would see that he had a good time.</p>
<p>Neither Madge, Phil, Lillian nor Eleanor felt
particularly pleased at this information. But
Tania, who was the only one of the party that
knew the young man well, burst unexpectedly
into a flood of tears, the cause of which she obstinately
refused to explain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN JULES, DEEP SEA DIVER</h3>
</div>

<p>The &#8220;Water Witch&#8221; rocked lazily on the
breast of the waves, awaiting the coming
of the four girls, who had planned to
row up the bay on a voyage of discovery. They
were not much interested in staying about
among the Cape May cottagers, after the conversation
which they had innocently overheard
from the deck of the launch the night before. Of
course, if Mrs. Curtis and Tom had come on to
Cape May at once to occupy their cottage, as
they had expected to do, all would have been
well. The four young women and their chaperon
would have been immediately introduced to
the society of the Cape. However, the girls
were not repining at their lack of society. They
had each other; there was the old town of Cape
May to be explored with the great ocean on one
side and Delaware Bay on the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do be careful, children,&#8221; called Miss Jenny
Ann warningly as the girls arranged themselves
for a row in their skiff. &#8220;In all our experience
on the water I never saw so many yachts and
pleasure boats as there are on these waters. If
you don&#8217;t keep a sharp lookout one of the larger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
boats may run into you. Don&#8217;t get into trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going away from trouble, Miss
Jenny Ann,&#8221; protested Phil. &#8220;There is a
yacht club on the sound, but we are going to row
up the bay past the shoals and get as far from
civilization as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge stood up in the skiff and waved her
hand to their chaperon. The girls looked like a
small detachment of feminine naval cadets in
their nautical uniforms. Each one of them wore
a dark blue serge skirt of ankle length and a
middy blouse with a blue sailor collar. They
were without hats, as they hoped to get a coating
of seashore tan without wasting any time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall expect you home by noon,&#8221; were
Miss Jenny Ann&#8217;s final words as the &#8220;Water
Witch&#8221; danced away from the houseboat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, Skipper!&#8221; the girls called back in
chorus. &#8220;Shall we bring back lobsters or clams
for luncheon, if we can find them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Clams!</i>&#8221; hallooed Miss Jenny Ann through
her hands. &#8220;I am dreadfully afraid of live lobsters.&#8221;
Then the houseboat chaperon retired to
write a letter to an artist, a Mr. Theodore
Brown, whose acquaintance she had made during
the first of the houseboat holidays. He had
suggested that he would like to come to Cape
May some time later in the summer if any of his
houseboat friends would be pleased to see him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
and she was writing to tell him just how greatly
pleased they would be.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; had found a quiet anchorage
in one of the smaller inlets of the Delaware
Bay, not far from the town of Cape May. The
larger number of the summer cottages were
farther away on the tiny islands near the sound
and along the ocean front.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Water Witch&#8221; sped gayly over the blue
waters of the bay in the brilliant late June sunshine.
Madge and Phil, as usual, were at the
oars. Tania crouched quietly at Lillian&#8217;s feet
in the stern of the skiff. Eleanor sat in the
prow.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of it all, Tania?&#8221; Madge
asked the little adopted houseboat daughter.
Tania had been very silent since their arrival at
the seashore. If she were impressed at the wonderful
and beautiful things she had seen since
she left New York City, she had, so far, said
nothing.</p>
<p>Her large black eyes blinked in the dazzling
light. She was looking straight up toward the
sky in a curious, absorbed fashion. &#8220;I was trying
to make up my mind, Madge, if this place
was as beautiful as my kingdom in Fairyland,&#8221;
answered Tania seriously, &#8220;and I believe it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a kingdom in Fairyland, little
Tania?&#8221; inquired Phil gently. She did not understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
the child&#8217;s odd fancies, as Madge did.</p>
<p>Tania nodded her head quietly. &#8220;Of course
I have,&#8221; she returned simply. &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t every
one a Fairyland, where things are just as they
should be, beautiful and good and kind? I am
the queen of my kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil looked puzzled, but Madge only laughed.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind Tania, Phil. She is going to be a
very sensible little houseboat girl before our
holiday is over. Besides, I understand her. She
only says some of the things I used to think
when I was a tiny child. But I do wish the people
on the boats would not stare at us so; there
is nothing very wonderful in our appearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls were trying to guide their rowboat
among the other larger craft that were afloat on
the bay. They wished to get into the more remote
waters. In the meantime it was embarrassing
to have smartly dressed women and girls
put up their lorgnettes and opera glasses to gaze
at the girls as the latter rowed by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can there be anything the matter with us?&#8221;
asked Phil solicitously. &#8220;I never saw anything
like this fire of inquisitive stares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not, Phil,&#8221; answered Lillian sensibly.
&#8220;It is only because we are strangers at
Cape May, and most of the people whom we see
about come here each year. Then we are the
only persons who live in a Noah&#8217;s ark, as those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
pleasant people on the yacht called our pretty
&#8216;Merry Maid&#8217; last night. Don&#8217;t worry. Have
you thought how odd it is that we won&#8217;t even
know them if we should be introduced to them
later? We did not see either them or their boat
very plainly last night; we only overheard them
talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll know the voice of that woman who
screamed,&#8221; replied Madge rather grimly. &#8220;I
just dare her to shriek again without my recognizing
her dulcet tones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls were now drawing away from the
crowded end of the bay. They kept along fairly
close to the shore. There was an occasional
house near the water, but these dwellings were
farther and farther apart. Finally the girls
rowed for half a mile without seeing any residence
save an occasional fisherman&#8217;s hut. They
hoped to reach some place where they could
catch at least a glimpse of the wonderful cedar
woods that flourish farther up the coast of the
bay.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lillian sang out: &#8220;Look, girls, there
is the dearest little house! It is almost in the
water. It rivals our houseboat, it is so like a
ship. Isn&#8217;t it too cunning for anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge and Phyllis rested on their oars. The
girls stared curiously.</p>
<p>They saw a house built of shingles that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
turned a soft gray which exactly resembled an
old three-masted schooner. It had a tiny porch
in front, but the first roof ended in a point, the
second rose higher, like a larger sail, and the
third, which must have covered the kitchen, was
about the height of the first.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Tania, I can make the funny house by
putting my fingers together,&#8221; laughed Lillian.
&#8220;My thumbs are the first roof, my three fingers
the second, and my little fingers the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls rowed nearer the odd cottage. The
place was deserted; at least they saw no one
about. Over the front door of the house hung a
trim little sign inscribed, &#8220;The Anchorage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, here is a boathouse, and we&#8217;ve a
houseboat!&#8221; exclaimed Eleanor. &#8220;I wish we
dared go ashore and knock at the door, to ask
some one to show us over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we had better try it, Eleanor,&#8221;
remonstrated Phil. &#8220;The house probably belongs
to some grouchy old sea captain who has
built it to get away from people.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this moment a man at least six feet tall,
wearing old yellow tarpaulins, came around the
side of the house of the three sails with a large
basket on each arm. He sat down on a rock in
front of the house and began lifting mussel and
oyster shells out of one of his baskets. He
would peer at them earnestly before throwing
them over to one side. He was a giant of a man,
past middle age. His face was so weather-beaten
that his skin was like leather. His eyes were
blue as only a sailor&#8217;s eyes can be. On one of
the man&#8217;s shoulders perched a wizened little
monkey that every now and then tugged at its
master&#8217;s grizzled hair or chattered in his ear.</p>

&#8220;Good Morning&#8221; Shouted Madge.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>The man did not observe the girls in the rowboat,
although they were only a few yards away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; sang out Madge cheerfully,
forgetting the vow of silence which the girls
had made that morning against the Cape Mayites.
But then, the girls had never dreamed of
seeing such a fascinating seafaring old mariner.
Their vow had been taken against the society
people.</p>
<p>The sailor, however, did not return Madge&#8217;s
friendly salutation; he went on examining his
oyster and mussel shells.</p>
<p>Madge looked crestfallen. The old sailor had
such a splendid, strong face. He did not seem to
be the kind of man who would fail to return a
friendly good morning greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he heard you, Madge. Let&#8217;s
all halloo together,&#8221; proposed Lillian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning!&#8221; shouted five young voices
in a mischievous chorus.</p>
<p>The seaman lifted his big head. His smile
came slowly, wrinkling his face into heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
creases. &#8220;Good morning, mates,&#8221; he called
heartily. &#8220;Coming ashore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, may we?&#8221; cried Madge in return. &#8220;We
should <i>dearly</i> love to!&#8221;</p>
<p>The five girls needed no further invitation.
They piled out of the &#8220;Water Witch&#8221; before
their host could come near enough to assist
them.</p>
<p>The seaman did not invite them into the
house. The girls took their seats on the big
rock near the water. Madge was farthest away,
but promptly the monkey leaped from its master&#8217;s
shoulder and planted itself in Madge&#8217;s
hair, pulling the strands violently while he chattered
angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You horrid little thing!&#8221; she cried; &#8220;you
hurt. I wonder if you hate red hair. Is that
the reason you are trying to pull mine out?
Please, somebody, take this playful beast
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old sea captain, as the girls guessed him
to be, promptly came to Madge&#8217;s rescue and removed
the angry monkey.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must forgive my pet,&#8221; he remarked
kindly. &#8220;My little Madge is jealous. She
doesn&#8217;t like strangers and we don&#8217;t often have
young lady visitors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge!&#8221; exclaimed the little captain, smiling
as she tried to re-arrange her hair. &#8220;What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
a funny name for a monkey. Why, that is my
name!&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few advances the monkey became very
friendly with the other girls, but she would have
nothing to do with Madge. She would fly into a
perfect tempest of rage whenever Madge approached
her or tried to talk to her. The monkey
even deserted her master to perch in Tania&#8217;s
arms. The animal put its little, scrawny arms
about the queer child&#8217;s neck, and there was almost
the same elfish, wistful look in both pairs
of dark eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you catch many fish in these waters?&#8221;
inquired Eleanor, whose housewifely soul was
interested in the big basket of lobsters that she
saw crawling about, writhing and twisting as
though they were in agony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost every kind that lives in temperate
waters,&#8221; answered the sailor, &#8220;but there is
nothing like the variety one finds in the tropics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you once a sea captain?&#8221; asked Lillian
curiously.</p>
<p>The man shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a captain
in the United States service,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;I
am called captain in these parts, &#8216;Captain
Jules,&#8217; but I have only commanded a freight
schooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I have no right to be so curious,&#8221; interposed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
Madge, &#8220;but I dearly love everything
about the sea. Were you ever a deep sea diver?
Somehow you look like one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a pearl-fisher for many years,&#8221; the
seaman answered as calmly as though diving for
pearls was one of the most ordinary trades in
the world. But his eyes twinkled as he heard
Madge&#8217;s gasp of admiration and caught the expression
on the faces of the other girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were looking for pearls in those oysters
and mussel shells when our boat came
along, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221; divined Madge, regarding
him with large eyes.</p>
<p>The man nodded a smiling answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I didn&#8217;t expect to find any pearls,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;It is strange how a man&#8217;s old
occupation will cling to him, even after he has
long ago given it up. There are very few pearls
to be found now in the Delaware Bay or the
waters around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules was gravely removing lobsters
from his basket for Tania&#8217;s entertainment while
he talked to Madge. Tania was watching him,
breathless with admiration and terror. The
captain would take hold of one of the great,
crawling things, rub it softly on its horned head
as one would rub a tabby cat to make it purr.
He would then set the lobster up on its hind
claws and the funny crustacean would fall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
quietly asleep, as though it were nodding in a
chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw anything so queer in my life,&#8221;
chuckled Phil. &#8220;You hypnotize the lobsters,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules shook his shaggy head. He
was proud of the appreciation his accomplishment
had excited. &#8220;No; I don&#8217;t hypnotize
them,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Anybody can make old
Father Lobster fall asleep if he only rubs him
in the right place. You are not going, are you?&#8221;
for the girls had risen to depart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid we must,&#8221; said Madge; &#8220;we
promised to get back to our houseboat by noon.
If you come down to Cape May, won&#8217;t you
please come to see us? Our houseboat is a rival
to your boathouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind,&#8221; answered the old captain,
shaking his head, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t do much
visiting. I thank you just the same. Let me fix
you up a basket of fish. Afraid of the lobsters,
aren&#8217;t you, little girl?&#8221; he said, smiling at Tania.</p>
<p>The old sailor followed his visitors to help
them aboard their rowboat. He walked beside
Madge, keeping a careful watch on his monkey,
which still chattered and gesticulated, showing
her hatred of the little captain.</p>
<p>The girls realized that this man had the manners
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
of a gentleman, although he looked as rough
and uncouth as a common sailor. There was a
kind of nobility about him, as of a man who has
lived and fought with the big things of the
earth.</p>
<p>Madge looked at him beseechingly just before
they arrived at their skiff. Now, when Madge
desired anything very greatly she was hard to
resist. Her blue eyes wore their most bewitching
expression. &#8220;Please,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;I
want you to do me a favor. I know I have no
right to ask it, but, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; inquired Captain Jules, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you your diving suit?&#8221; asked Madge.
&#8220;If you have, and you would show it to me some
day, I would be too happy for words.&#8221; Madge
blushed at her own temerity.</p>
<p>The captain shook his head. There was little
encouragement in his expression. &#8220;Maybe,
some day,&#8221; he replied vaguely; &#8220;but I have
had the suit put away for some time. Who
knows when I will go down into the sea again?
Be careful in that small skiff,&#8221; he warned the
girls. &#8220;There are so many launches about on
these waters, run by men and women that don&#8217;t
know the very first principles of running a boat,
that a small craft like yours may easily drift
into danger. You must look lively.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>The girls waved their good-byes as Madge
and Phil pulled away. Madge noticed that the
old sailor stared curiously at her, and every
now and then he shook his head and frowned.
Madge supposed it was because she had been so
bold as to ask a favor of a perfect stranger.
Yet, if she could only see Captain Jules again
and he might be persuaded to show her his diving
suit and to tell her something of the strange
business of pearl-fishing, she couldn&#8217;t be really
sorry for her impudence. This accidental meeting
with an old sailor inspired Madge afresh
with her love of the sea and the mystery of it.
She could not get the man out of her mind, nor
her own desire to see him soon again and to ask
him more questions.</p>
<p>As for Captain Jules, when the girls had
fairly gone he lighted his pipe and strode along
the line of the shore. &#8220;It&#8217;s a funny thing,
Madge,&#8221; he said, addressing the monkey, &#8220;but
when a man gets an idea in his head, everything
and everybody he sees seems to start the same
old idea a-going. I wish I had asked her to tell
me her surname. I wonder if she is the real
Madge?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE WRECK OF THE &#8220;WATER WITCH&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>The girls began their row to the &#8220;Merry
Maid&#8221; with all speed. They had had
such an interesting morning that they
did not realize how the time had flown. They
did not know the exact hour now, but they feared
it would be after twelve before they could rejoin
Miss Jenny Ann. The sun was so nearly
overhead and shining so brilliantly that the effect
was almost dazzling. Madge and Phil did
not try to see any distance ahead in their
course. Lillian, however, was on the lookout.
There were several inlets opening into the
larger water-way down which the girls were
rowing. Boats were likely to come unexpectedly
out of these inlets, and the girls should have
been far more watchful than they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad about Mrs. Curtis and Tom not
coming on to Cape May as soon as we expected
them, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; remarked Phil, resting for half
a moment from the strain of the steady pulling
at her oars. &#8220;I hope they will arrive soon, before
we have the responsibility of entertaining
Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s friend, Philip Holt. It won&#8217;t be
much fun to have a strange man following us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
about everywhere, even if he should turn out
to be nicer than we think he is.&#8221; Phil was the
stroke oar. She was talking over her shoulder
to Madge, who was paying more attention to her
friend&#8217;s conversation than to her rowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think Mrs. Curtis and Tom will be
along soon,&#8221; she rejoined. &#8220;I felt dreadfully
when we received the telegram this morning.
But now I hope Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s brother will get
well in a hurry. Perhaps they will be here almost
as soon as this Philip. I&#8217;ll wager you a
pound of chocolates, Phil, that this goody-goody
young man can&#8217;t swim or row, or do anything
like an ordinary person. He will just think
every single thing we do is perfectly dreadful,
and will frighten Tania to death with his preaching.
I know he thinks her fairy stories are lies.
He told Mrs. Curtis that Tania never spoke the
truth.&#8221; Madge lowered her voice. &#8220;I am sure
we have never caught her in a lie. I suppose this
Philip will think my exaggerations are as bad
as Tania&#8217;s fairy stories. I hate too literal people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, whom are you and Phil discussing,
Madge?&#8221; inquired Lillian, leaning over from
her seat in the stern with Tania, to try to catch
her friends&#8217; low-voiced conversation. &#8220;If it is
that Philip Holt, you need not think that he will
trouble us very much when he comes to Cape
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
May. He is just the kind of person who will
trot after all the rich people he meets, and waste
very little energy on those who have neither
money nor social position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lillian was looking at Madge and Phil as she
talked. For the moment she forgot to keep a
sharp watch about on the water. But a moment
since there had been no other boats in sight near
them. Eleanor was resting in the prow with
her eyes closed. The sun blazed hotly in her
face, she could only see a bright light dancing
before her eyes.</p>
<p>As Lillian leaned back in her seat in the stern
her face took on an expression of sudden alarm.
At the same moment the four girls heard the
distinct chug of a motor engine. Cutting down
upon them was a pleasure yacht run by a gasoline
motor. The prow of the yacht was head-on
with the &#8220;Water Witch&#8221; and running at full
speed. The boat had blown no whistle, so the
girls had not seen its approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look ahead!&#8221; shouted Lillian.</p>
<p>The young man who was steering the yacht
paid no heed to her warning. He kept straight
ahead, although he distinctly saw the rowboat
and its passengers.</p>
<p>Madge and Phyllis had no time to call out or
to protest. They realized, almost instantly, that
the motor launch meant to make no effort to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
slow down but to put the full responsibility of
getting out of danger on the rowers.</p>
<p>The girls had no particular desire to be
thrown into the water, nor to have their boat
cut in two, so they pulled for dear life, with
white faces and straining throats and arms.</p>
<p>They just missed making their escape by a
hair&#8217;s breadth. The young man running the
yacht must have believed that the skiff would get
safely by or else when he found out his mistake
it was too late for him to slow down. The prow
of his yacht ran with full force into the frail side
of the &#8220;Water Witch&#8221; near her stern.</p>
<p>The little skiff whirled in the water almost in
a semi-circle. By a miracle it escaped being
completely run down by the launch. Yet a second
later, before any one of the girls could stir,
the water rushed into the hole in its side and it
sank. Madge and Phyllis had had their oars
wrenched from their hands. Then they found
themselves struggling in the water.</p>
<p>A cry rose from the launch as the &#8220;Water
Witch&#8221; and her passengers disappeared. But
there was no sound from the little rowboat, save
the gurgle of the water and a shrill scream
from Tania as the waves closed over her head.</p>
<p>The yacht swept on past, borne perhaps by
her own headway.</p>
<p>As Madge went down under the water two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
thoughts seemed to come to her mind in the
same second: she must look after Eleanor and
Tania. Her cousin, Nellie, was not able to swim
as well as the other girls. She had always been
more nervous and timid in the water and was
liable to sudden cramp. Madge knew that being
hurled from a boat in such sudden fashion with
her clothes on instead of a bathing suit would
completely terrify Eleanor. She might lose her
presence of mind completely and fail to strike
out when she rose to the surface of the water.
As for Tania, Madge was aware that she, of
course, could not swim a stroke. The little one
had never been in deep water before in her life.</p>
<p>Madge struggled for breath for a second as
she came to the surface of the bay again. She
had swallowed some salt water as she went
down. In the next desperate instant she counted
three heads above the waves besides her own.
Phyllis was swimming quietly toward Eleanor.
Evidently she had entertained Madge&#8217;s fear.
&#8220;Make for the &#8216;Water Witch,&#8217; Nellie,&#8221; Madge
heard Phil say in her calm, cool-headed fashion.
&#8220;It has overturned and come up again and we
can hang on to that. Don&#8217;t be frightened. I am
coming after you. Try to float if your clothes
are too heavy to swim. I&#8217;ll pull you to the
boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lillian&#8217;s golden head reflected the light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
from the sun&#8217;s rays as she swam along after
Phil. But nowhere could Madge see a sign of a
little, wild, black head with its straight, short
locks and frightened black eyes.</p>
<p>She waited for another breathless moment.
Why did Tania not rise to the surface like the
rest of them? Madge was trying to tread water
and to keep a sharp lookout about her, but her
clothes were heavy and kept pulling her down;
swimming in heavy shoes is an extremely difficult
business, even for an experienced swimmer.
All of a sudden it occurred to Madge that Tania
might have risen under the overturned rowboat.
Then her head would have struck against its
bottom and she would have gone down again
without ever having been seen.</p>
<p>There was nothing else to be done. Madge
must dive down to see what had become of her
little friend, yet diving was difficult when she
had no place from which to dive. Madge knew
she must get all the way down to the very bottom
of the bay to see if by any chance Tania&#8217;s
body could have been entangled among the sea
weed, or her clothes caught on a rock or snag.</p>
<p>Once down, she looked in vain for the little
body along the sandy bottom of the bay. She
espied some rocks covered with shimmering
shells and sea ferns, but there was no trace of
Tania. For the second time she rose to the surface
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
of the water. She hoped to see Tania&#8217;s
black head glistening among those of her older
friends clustered about the overturned boat.
She had grown very tired and was obliged to
shake the water out of her eyes before she dared
trust herself to look.</p>
<p>Then she saw that Phil had hold of one of
Eleanor&#8217;s hands and with the other was clinging
to the slippery side of their overturned
boat. Eleanor was numb with cold and shock.
Although her free hand rested on the boat, Phil
dared not let go of her for fear she would sink.</p>
<p>Phyllis was beginning to feel uneasy about
Madge. She had given no thought to her during
the early part of the accident, she knew
Madge to be a water witch herself, but when the
little captain did not come to the skiff with the
rest of them Phil&#8217;s heart grew heavy. What
could she do? Dare she let go her hold on
Eleanor? Strangely enough, in their peril,
Phyllis had given no thought to the little stranger,
Tania.</p>
<p>Phyllis Alden breathed a happy sigh of relief
when she saw Madge&#8217;s curly, red-brown head
moving along toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Tania?&#8221; she called faintly,
trying to reserve both her breath and her
strength.</p>
<p>Then Phil remembered Tania with a rush of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
remorse and terror. &#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t, Madge.
What could have become of the child?&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>Lillian looked out over the water. Surely the
launch that had wrecked them would have been
able by this time to come back to their assistance.
The boat had stopped, but it had not
moved near to them. So far, its crew showed
no sign of giving them any aid. Lillian could
not believe her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better dive for Tania again,&#8221; said
Madge quietly, without intimating to her chums
that she was feeling a little tired and less sure
of herself in the water than usual. She knew
they would not allow her to dive.</p>
<p>When she went down for Tania the second
time she chose a different place to make her descent.
She must find the little girl at once.</p>
<p>She was swimming along, not many inches
from the bottom of the bay, when she caught
sight of what seemed to her a large fish floating
near some rocks. Madge swam toward it slowly.
It was Tania&#8217;s foot, swaying with the motion
of the water. Caught on a spar, which
might have once been part of a mast of an old
ship, was Tania&#8217;s dress. On the other side of
her was a rock, and her body had become wedged
between the two objects. It was a beautiful
place and might have been a cave for a mermaid,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
but it held the little earth-princess in a
death-like grasp.</p>
<p>It is possible to be sick with fear and yet
to be brave. Madge knew her danger. She
saw that Tania&#8217;s dress was caught fast. She
would have to tug at it valiantly to get it away.
First, she pulled desperately at Tania&#8217;s shoe,
hoping she could free her body. A suffocating
weight had begun to press down on her chest.
She could hear a roaring and buzzing in her
ears. She knew enough of the water to realize
that she had been too long underneath; she
should rise to the surface again to get her
breath. But she dared not wait so long to release
Tania. Nor did she know that she could
find the child again when she returned. She
must do her work now.</p>
<p>So Madge pulled more slowly and carefully
at Tania&#8217;s frock, unwinding it from the spar
that held it. With a few gentle tugs she released
it and Tania&#8217;s slender body rose slowly. The
child&#8217;s eyes were closed, her face was as still
and white as though she were dead. Madge was
glad of Tania&#8217;s unconsciousness. She knew that
in this lay the one chance of safety for herself
and the child. If Tania came to consciousness
and began to struggle the little captain knew
that her strength was too far gone for her to
save either the child or herself. She would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
leave her. She would have to drown with her.</p>
<p>She caught the little girl by her black hair, and
swam out feebly with her one free arm. At this
moment Tania&#8217;s black eyes opened wide. She
realized their awful peril. She was only a child,
and the fear of the drowning swept over her.
She gave a despairing clutch upward, threw
both her thin arms about Madge&#8217;s neck and held
her in a grasp of steel. For a second Madge
tried to fight Tania&#8217;s hands away. Then her
strength gave out utterly. She realized that the
end had come for them both.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE OWNER OF THE DISAGREEABLE VOICE</h3>
</div>

<p>It may be that Madge had another second of
consciousness. Afterward she thought she
could recall being caught up by a giant,
who unloosed Tania&#8217;s hands from about her
throat. Quietly the three of them began to float
upward with such steadiness, such quietness,
that she had that blessed sense of security and
release from responsibility that a child must
feel who has fallen asleep in its father&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>The first thing that she actually knew was,
when she opened her eyes, to look into a pair of
deep blue, kindly ones that were smiling bravely
and encouragingly into hers. Near her were her
three friends, looking very wet and miserable,
and one little, dark-eyed elf who was sobbing
bitterly. Farther away were two strange girls
and one red-faced young man. Then Madge understood
that she had been brought aboard the
yacht that had run down their rowboat.</p>
<p>The little captain sat up indignantly. &#8220;I am
quite all right,&#8221; she said haughtily, looking with
an unfriendly countenance at their wreckers.
Then, feeling strangely dizzy, she sank back and
with a little sigh closed her eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; protested Eleanor tragically.
&#8220;You must not faint. Captain Jules,
please don&#8217;t let her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old captain&#8217;s strong hands took hold of
Madge&#8217;s cold ones. &#8220;Pull yourself together, my
hearty,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;A girl who can dive
down into the bottom of the bay as you can
shows she has good sea-blood in her. She can
see the old captain&#8217;s diving suit any day she
likes&mdash;own it if she has a mind to. Fishing for
pearls isn&#8217;t half so good a trade as fishing for a
human life. You&#8217;ll be yourself in a minute.
Lucky I happened to walk down the beach in the
same direction your boat went.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the two strange girls came to Madge&#8217;s
side at this moment with a cup of strong tea.
&#8220;<i>Do</i> drink this,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;It has taken
some time to make the water boil. I wish to give
some to the other girls, too. I am so sorry that
we ran into you. You must know that it was
an accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge drank the tea obediently, gazing a little
less scornfully at the girl who was serving her,
her face pale with fright and sympathy. The
other girl stood apart at a little distance with a
young man. They were both staring at the wet
and shivering girls with poorly concealed
amusement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are awfully sorry to give you so much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
trouble,&#8221; said Madge to the girl with the tea.
She was trying to control her feelings when she
caught sight of the owner of the small yacht and
his friend and her temper got the better of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;that we are giving
<i>you</i> trouble. But, really, your motor launch
had no right to bear down on our boat without
blowing its whistle or giving the faintest sign of
its approach. It put the whole responsibility of
getting out of the way on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge was sitting beside the old captain. Her
direct mode of attack showed that she was feeling
more like herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the young lady says is true,&#8221; declared
Captain Jules with emphasis. &#8220;I doubt if you
have the faintest legal right to navigate a boat
in these waters. If I hadn&#8217;t happened to walk
along down the shore of the bay after these
young ladies left me two of them would have
been drowned. I&#8217;ll have to see to it that you
keep off this bay if you do any more such mischief
as you did this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man in a handsome yachting suit
worthy of an admiral in the United States Navy
frowned angrily at Madge and her champion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say it wasn&#8217;t my fault that I ran into your
little paper boat,&#8221; he protested angrily. &#8220;I gave
you plenty of time to get out of my way, but you
girls pulled so slowly that we did slide into you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Still, if you will admit that it was your fault and
not mine, I will have your old skiff mended, if
she isn&#8217;t too much used up and you can get
somebody to tow her back to land for you. I
can&#8217;t; I have enough to carry as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl standing beside the young man giggled
hysterically. Madge decided that she had
heard her high, shrill notes before. Phyllis, Lillian
and Eleanor were furiously angry at the
young man&#8217;s retort to Madge and Captain
Jules, but they bit their lips and said nothing.
They were on his yacht, although they were enforced
passengers; it was better not to express
their feelings.</p>
<p>But Madge was in a white heat of passion
over the young man&#8217;s boorish retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not our fault in the least that we were
run down,&#8221; she said in a low, evenly pitched
voice. &#8220;We are not willing to take the least
bit of the blame. You not only ran into our little
boat and sunk her, but you did not take the
least trouble to come to our aid when you had
not the faintest knowledge whether any one of
us could swim. <i>Men</i> in the part of the world
where I come from don&#8217;t do things of that kind.
Put your boat back and tow our rowboat to
land,&#8221; ordered Madge imperiously. &#8220;We certainly
will not allow you to have it mended.
Neither my friends nor I wish to accept any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
kind of recompense from a man who is a <i>coward</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>The word was out. Madge had not meant to
use it, but somehow it slipped off her tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady,&#8221; she heard the old sailor whisper in
her ear. He was gazing at her intently, and
something in his face calmed the hot tide of her
anger. &#8220;I am sorry I said you were a coward,&#8221;
she added, with one of her quick repentances.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you were very brave, but perhaps
something may have happened that prevented
your coming to our aid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dennis does not swim very well,&#8221; the
nicer of the two girls explained, sitting down
beside Madge. She was blushing and biting her
lips. &#8220;Mr. Dennis meant to put back as soon
as he could. I am Ethel Swann. I received a
letter from Mrs. Curtis this morning, who is one
of my mother&#8217;s old friends. She wrote that she
and her son would be down a little later to open
their cottage, but she hoped that we would meet
you girls before she came. I am so sorry that
we have met first in such an unfortunate fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind,&#8221; interrupted Madge impatiently.
&#8220;If you are Ethel Swann, Mrs. Curtis
has talked to us about you. We are very glad to
know you, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are my friends, Roy Dennis and Mabel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Farrar,&#8221; Ethel went on, her face flushing.
The four girls bowed coldly. Mabel Farrar
acknowledged the introduction by a stiff nod.
The young man took off his cap for the first
time when Madge introduced Captain Jules.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run your boat along the side of the overturned
skiff and I&#8217;ll tie her on for you,&#8221; ordered
Captain Jules quietly. &#8220;I think I had better
go along back to land with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roy Dennis, who was a little more frightened
at his deed than he cared to own, was glad to
obey the captain&#8217;s order.</p>
<p>Just as the girls were landing from the launch
Mabel Farrar&#8217;s foot slipped and she gave a
shrill scream. Instantly the girls recognized the
voice which they had heard the night before condemning
them to social oblivion.</p>
<p>Although Captain Jules had only a short time
before positively refused the invitation of the
girls to come aboard the &#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; to pay
them a visit, it was he who handed each girl from
the deck of Roy Dennis&#8217;s boat into the arms of
their frightened chaperon. Finally he crossed
over to the deck of the houseboat himself, bearing
little Tania in his arms and looking in his
wet tarpaulins like old King Neptune rising
from the brine.</p>
<p>Captain Jules was made to stay to luncheon
on board the houseboat. There was no getting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
away from the determined young women. In his
heart of hearts the old sailor had no desire to
go. Something inspired him with the desire to
know more of these charming girls.</p>
<p>When the girls had put on dry clothing they
led Captain Jules all over the houseboat, showing
him each detail of it. He insisted that the
&#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; was as trim a little craft as he
had ever seen afloat.</p>
<p>After luncheon, at which the captain devoured
six of Miss Jenny Ann&#8217;s best cornbread
gems, he sat down in a chair on the houseboat
deck, holding Tania in his arms. He talked most
to Phyllis, but he seldom took his eyes off
Madge&#8217;s face. Sometimes he frowned at her;
now and then he smiled. Once or twice Madge
found herself blushing and wondering why her
rescuer looked at her so hard, but she was too
interested to care very much.</p>
<p>She sat down in her favorite position on a
pile of cushions on the deck, with her head resting
against Miss Jenny Ann&#8217;s knee and her eyes
on the water. &#8220;Do tell us, Captain Jules,&#8221; she
pleaded, &#8220;something about your life as a pearl-fisher.
You must have had wonderful experiences.
We would dearly love to hear about
them, wouldn&#8217;t we, girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls chorused an enthusiastic &#8220;Yes,&#8221;
which included Miss Jenny Ann.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>Captain Jules laughed. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you ever
heard that it is dangerous to get an old sea dog
started on his adventures? You never can tell
when he will leave off,&#8221; he teased, stroking
Tania&#8217;s black hair. &#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if Tania would like to hear how once I
was nearly swallowed whole, diving suit and all,
by a giant shark. I was hunting for pearls in
those days off the Philippine Islands. I had
been tearing some shells from the side of a great
rock when, of a sudden, I felt a strange presence
before I saw anything. I might have known it
was time to expect trouble, because the little fish
that are usually floating about in the water had
all disappeared. A creepy feeling came over
me. I was cold as ice inside my diving suit.
Then I turned and looked up. Just a few feet
in front of me was a giant shark that seemed
about twenty-five feet long. He was an evil
monster. The upper part of his body was a
dirty, dark green and his fins were black. You
never saw a diving suit, did you? So you don&#8217;t
know that all the body is covered up but the
hands. I tucked my hands under my breastplate
in a hurry. It didn&#8217;t seem to me that a pearl
diver would be much good without any hands.
Well, the great fish made a sweep with its tail,
and in a jiffy he and I were face to face. I stood
still for about a second. I held my breath, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
heart pounding like a hammer. Nearer and
nearer the monster came swimming toward me,
with its shovel nose pointing directly at the
glass that covered my face. I couldn&#8217;t stand it.
I threw up my hands. I yelled way down at the
bottom of the sea with no one to hear me. There
was a swirl of water, a cloud of mud, and my
enemy vanished. He didn&#8217;t like the noise any
better than I liked him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls breathed sighs of relief. The captain
chuckled. &#8220;Oh, a diver is not in real danger
from a shark,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;his suit protects
him. But there are plenty of other dangers.
Maybe I&#8217;ll tell you some of them at another
time. Why, I declare, it is nearly sunset.
You don&#8217;t know it, children, but the bottom of
the tropic sea has colors in it as beautiful as the
lights in that sky. The sea-bottom, where the
diver is apt to find pearl shells, is covered with
all sorts of sea growths&mdash;sponges twelve feet
high, coral cups like inverted mushrooms, sea-fans
twenty feet broad.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the old diver talked, the girls could see the
magic coral wreaths, glowing rose color and
crimson, the tall ferns and sea flowers that waved
with the movement of the water as the earth
flowers move to the stirring of the wind. And
there in the land of the mermaids, hidden between
wonderful shells of mother-of-pearl, lie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the jewels that are the purest and most beautiful
in the world.</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s chin was in her hands. She did not
hear the old captain get up and say good-bye.
She was wishing, with all her heart, that she,
too, might go down to the bottom of the sea to
view its treasures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge,&#8221; Phil interrupted her reverie,
&#8220;Captain Jules is going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge put her soft, warm hands into the big
man&#8217;s hard, powerful ones. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she
said gratefully. &#8220;There is something I wish to
tell you, but I won&#8217;t until another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann stared thoughtfully after the
giant figure as Captain Jules left the houseboat
and strode up the shore in search of a small
skiff to take him home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You girls have made an unusual friend,&#8221;
she said slowly to Madge. &#8220;In many ways Captain
Jules is rough. He may be uneducated in
the wisdom of schools and books, but he is a
great man with a great heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Madge went to bed that night she
wrote Tom Curtis. She told him how sorry they
all were that he could not come at once to Cape
May. She also described the day&#8217;s adventures.
She made as light of their accident as possible,
but she ended her letter by asking Tom if he
would not send her a book about pearl fishing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE GOODY-GOODY YOUNG MAN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Philip Holt has come, Madge,&#8221;
announced Phyllis Alden a few days
later. &#8220;He is staying at one of the
hotels until Mrs. Curtis and Tom arrive to open
their cottage. He has already been calling on a
number of Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s friends here. Now he
has condescended to come to see us. Miss Jenny
Ann says we must invite him to luncheon; so
close that book, if you please, and come help us
to entertain him. I am sure you will be <i>so</i> pleased
to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge frowned, but closed her book obediently.
&#8220;What a bore, Phil! I was just reading
this fascinating book on pearl-fishing. A few
valuable pearls have been found in these waters.
There was one which was sold to a princess for
twenty-five hundred dollars. Who knows but
the &#8216;Merry Maid&#8217; may even now be reposing
on a bank of pearls! Dear me, here is that tiresome
Mr. Holt! Of course, we must be nice with
him on Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s account. I hope she and
Tom will soon come along. Let us take Mr. Holt
with us to the golf club this afternoon. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
promised Ethel Swann to come and she won&#8217;t
mind our bringing him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls were not altogether surprised that
the young people whom they had lately met at
Cape May were divided into two sets. The one
had taken the girls under their protection and
seemed to like them immensely. The other,
headed by Mabel Farrar and Roy Dennis, treated
them with cool contempt. But the girls felt
able to take care of themselves. Not one of them
even inquired what story Mr. Dennis and Miss
Farrar had told about their memorable meeting
on the water.</p>
<p>The Cape May golf course stretches over
miles of beautiful downs and the clubhouse is
the gathering place for society at this summer
resort.</p>
<p>Ethel Swann bore off Lillian and Eleanor to
introduce them to some of her friends, and the
three girls followed the course of two of the
players over the links.</p>
<p>Philip Holt was plainly impressed by the
smartly-dressed women and girls whom he saw
about him. He was a tall, thin young man with
sandy hair and he wore spectacles. He insisted
that Madge and Phyllis should not forget to introduce
him as the friend of Mrs. Curtis, who
expected him to be her guest later on. Indeed,
Philip Holt talked so constantly and so intimately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
of Mrs. Curtis that Madge had to stifle
a little pang of jealousy. She had supposed,
when she was in New York City, that Mrs. Curtis,
who was very generous, only took a friendly
interest in Philip Holt and his work among the
New York poor, but to-day Philip Holt gave
her to understand that Mrs. Curtis was as kind
to him as though he were a member of her family.
And Madge wondered wickedly to herself
whether Tom Curtis would be pleased to have
him for a brother. She determined to interview
Tom on the subject as soon as he should return
from Chicago.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon Madge and Phyllis
were surprised to see Roy Dennis and Mabel
Farrar come down the golf clubhouse steps and
walk across the lawn toward them, smiling with
apparent friendliness. Madge&#8217;s resentful expression
softened. She did not bear malice, and
she felt that she had said more to Roy Dennis
about his treatment of them than she should
have done. She, therefore, bowed pleasantly.
Phil followed suit. To their amazement they
were greeted with a frozen stare by the newcomers,
who walked to where the two girls were
standing without paying the least attention to
the latter. Madge&#8217;s color rose to the very roots
of her hair. Phil&#8217;s black eyes flashed, but she
kept them steadily fixed on the girl and man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Holt?&#8221; asked Mabel in
bland tones, addressing the girls&#8217; companion.
&#8220;I believe I am right in calling you Mr. Holt. I
have heard that you were a friend of Mrs. Curtis
and her son. This is my friend, Roy Dennis.
We are so pleased to meet any of dear Mrs.
Curtis&#8217;s <i>real</i> friends. We should like to have
you take tea with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip Holt looked perplexed. He opened his
mouth to introduce Madge and Phyllis to Miss
Farrar, but the girls&#8217; expressions told the story.</p>
<p>Miss Farrar and Mr. Dennis had purposely
excluded the two girls from the conversation.</p>
<p>For the fraction of a second Philip Holt wavered.
Mabel Farrar was smartly dressed. Roy
Dennis looked the rich, idle society man that he
was. Moneyed friends were always the most
useful in Mr. Holt&#8217;s opinion, he therefore turned
to Miss Farrar with, &#8220;I shall be only too pleased
to accompany you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll excuse me,&#8221; he turned condescendingly
to Madge and Phil, &#8220;but Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s
friends wish me to have tea with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge smiled at the young man with such
frank amusement that he was embarrassed.
&#8220;Oh, yes, we will excuse you,&#8221; she said lightly.
&#8220;Please don&#8217;t give another thought to us. Miss
Alden and I wish you to consult your own pleasure.
I am sure that you will find it in drinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
tea!&#8221; She turned away, the picture of calm indifference,
although she had a wicked twinkle
in her eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that wasn&#8217;t the rudest behavior all
around that I ever saw in my life!&#8221; burst out
Phil indignantly after the disagreeable trio had
departed. &#8220;Mrs. Curtis or no Mrs. Curtis, I
don&#8217;t think we should be expected to speak to
that ill-bred Mr. Holt again. The idea of his
marching off with that girl and man after the
way they treated us! I shall tell Mrs. Curtis
just how he behaved as soon as I see her, then
she won&#8217;t think him so delightful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge put her arm inside Phil&#8217;s. &#8220;You had
better not mention it to Mrs. Curtis, Phil. Mrs.
Curtis is the dearest person in the world, but she
is so lovely and so rich that she is used always to
having her own way. She thinks that we girls
are prejudiced against this Mr. Holt because he
said the things he did about Tania. By the way,
I wonder what the little witch has against him?
I mean to ask her some day. But let&#8217;s not
trouble about Philip Holt any more. He is just
a toady. I don&#8217;t care what he says or does. We
have done our duty by him for this afternoon at
least. He won&#8217;t join us again. Let&#8217;s go over to
that lovely hill and have a good, old-fashioned
talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s face cleared. After all, she and Madge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
could get along much, better without troublesome
outsiders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a wonderful afternoon, Phil?&#8221; asked
the little captain after they had climbed the little
hill and were seated on a grassy knoll. &#8220;We
can see the ocean over there! Wouldn&#8217;t you like
to be swimming down there under the water,
where it is so cool and lovely and there would
be nothing to trouble one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a water-baby you are,&#8221; smiled Phil,
giving her chum&#8217;s arm a soft pressure. &#8220;I
sometimes think that you must have come out
of a sea-shell. I suppose you are thinking of the
old pearl diver again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; demanded Madge abruptly, &#8220;have
you ever thought of what profession you would
have liked to follow if you had been born a boy
instead of a girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not have to think to answer that,&#8221; replied
Phyllis, &#8220;I know. If I were a boy, I should
study to become a physician, like my father;
but even though I am a girl, I am going to study
medicine just the same. As soon as we get
through college I shall begin my course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; Madge&#8217;s voice sounded unusually serious,
&#8220;don&#8217;t set your heart too much, dear, on
my going to college with you in the fall. I don&#8217;t
know it positively, but I think that Uncle is having
some business trouble. He and Aunt have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
been worried for the past year about some stocks
they own. I shan&#8217;t feel that I have any right to
let them send me to college unless I can make
up my mind that I shall be willing to teach to
earn my living afterward. And I can&#8217;t teach,
Phil, dear. I should never make a successful
teacher,&#8221; ended Madge with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine you as a teacher,&#8221; smiled
Phil, &#8220;but I am sure that you will marry before
you are many years older.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry!&#8221; protested Madge indignantly.
&#8220;Why do you think I shall marry? Why, I was
wishing this very minute that I were a man so
that I could set out on a voyage of discovery and
sail around the world in a little ship of my own.
Or, think, one might be a pearl-diver, or lead
some exciting life like that. Now, Phil Alden,
don&#8217;t you go and arrange for me just to marry
and keep house and never have a bit of fun or
any excitement in my whole life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyllis laughed teasingly. &#8220;Oh, you will
have plenty of excitement, Madge dear, wherever
you are or whatever you do. Don&#8217;t you remember
how Miss Betsey used to say that she
knew something was going to happen whenever
you were about? I suppose you would like to be
a captain in the Navy like your father, so that
you could spend all your time on the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned Madge, &#8220;I should want a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
ship of my own. I wouldn&#8217;t like to be a captain
in the Navy. There, you always have to do just
what you are told to do, and you know, Phil, that
obedience is not my strong point.&#8221; The little
captain laughed and shook her russet head.
&#8220;You see, Phil, I think that if I could go around
the world, perhaps in some far-away land I
would find my father waiting for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>For several minutes the two chums were silent.
At last Phil leaned forward and gave
Madge&#8217;s arm a gentle pinch. &#8220;Wake up, dear,&#8221;
she laughed, &#8220;perhaps some day you will own
that little ship and go around the world in it.
Just now, however, we had better go on to the
houseboat. I believe Nellie and Lillian are going
to wait at the golf club until the last mail
comes in, so they can bring our letters along
home with them. We must say good-bye to that
nice Ethel Swann. She is a dear, in spite of her
ill-bred friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phyllis and Madge found Miss Jenny Ann sitting
in a steamer chair on the houseboat deck
exchanging fairy stories with Tania. The little
girl knew almost as many as did her chaperon,
but Tania&#8217;s stories were so full of her own odd
fancies that it was hard to tell from what source
they had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the story of &#8216;The Little Tin
Soldier,&#8217; Tania?&#8221; Miss Jenny Ann had just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
asked. &#8220;He was the bravest little soldier in the
world, because he bore all kinds of misfortunes
and never complained.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a whirl Tania was out of Miss Jenny
Ann&#8217;s lap and into Madge&#8217;s arms. The child
was devoted to each member of the houseboat
party, but she was Madge&#8217;s ardent adorer. She
liked to play that she was the little captain&#8217;s
Fairy Godmother, and that she could grant any
wish that Madge might make.</p>
<p>Phil, Madge and Tania sat down at Miss Jenny
Ann&#8217;s feet to hear more about &#8220;The Brave
Little Tin Soldier.&#8221; Tania huddled close to
Madge, her black head resting against the older
girl&#8217;s curls, as she listened to the harrowing adventures
that befell the Tin Soldier.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking. Away over the water
the world seemed rose colored, but the shadows
were deepening on the land. Phil espied Lillian
and Eleanor coming toward the houseboat. Lillian
waved a handful of white envelopes, but
Eleanor walked more slowly and did not glance
up toward her friends.</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann rose hurriedly. &#8220;I must go
in to see to our dinner,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;Phil,
after you have spoken to the girls, will you come
in to help me? Madge may stay to look after
Tania.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little captain was absorbed in a quiet twilight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
dream, and as Tania was in her lap she
did not get up when Phil went forward to meet
Lillian and Eleanor.</p>
<p>Instantly Phil realized that something was the
matter with Nellie. Eleanor&#8217;s face was white
and drawn and there were tears in her gentle,
brown eyes. Lillian also looked worried and
sympathetic, but was evidently trying to appear
cheerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Eleanor? Has any one
hurt your feelings?&#8221; asked Phil immediately.
Eleanor was the youngest of the girls and always
the one to be protected. Phyllis guessed
that perhaps some one of the unpleasant acquaintances
of Roy Dennis and Mabel Farrar
might have been unkind to her.</p>
<p>But Eleanor shook her head dumbly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nellie has had some bad news from home,&#8221;
answered Lillian, tenderly putting her arm
about Eleanor. &#8220;Perhaps it isn&#8217;t so bad as she
thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge overheard Lillian&#8217;s speech and, lifting
Tania from her lap, sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nellie, darling, what is it? Tell me at
once!&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;If Uncle and Aunt are
ill, we must go to them at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so bad as that, Madge,&#8221; answered
Eleanor, finding her voice; &#8220;only Mother has
written to tell us that Father has lost a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
deal of money. He has had to mortgage dear
old &#8216;Forest House,&#8217; and if he doesn&#8217;t get a lot
more money by fall, &#8216;Forest House&#8217; will have to
be sold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nellie broke down. The thought of having to
give up her dear old Virginia home, that had
been in their family for five generations, was
more than she could bear.</p>
<p>Madge kissed Eleanor gently. In the face of
great difficulties Madge was not the harum-scarum
person she seemed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry too
much, Nellie,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;If Uncle and Aunt
are well, then the loss of the money isn&#8217;t so
dreadful. Somehow, I don&#8217;t believe we shall
have to give up &#8216;Forest House.&#8217; It would be too
frightful! Perhaps Uncle will find the money in
time to save it, or we shall get it in some way.
I am nearly grown now. I ought to be able to
help. Anyhow, I don&#8217;t mean to be an expense
to Uncle and Aunt any more after this summer.&#8221;
Madge&#8217;s face clouded, although she tried
to conceal her dismay. &#8220;Do Uncle and Aunt
want us to leave the houseboat and come home
at once?&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s and Lillian&#8217;s faces were as long and as
gloomy as their other chums&#8217; at this suggestion.</p>
<p>But Eleanor shook her head firmly. &#8220;No;
Father says positively that he does not wish us
to leave the houseboat until our holiday is over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
It is not costing us very much and he wishes us
to have a good time this summer, so that we can
bear whatever happens next winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one had noticed little Tania while the
houseboat girls were talking. Her eyes were
bigger and blacker than ever, and as Madge
turned to go into the cabin she saw that there
were tears in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Tania?&#8221; putting her arms about
the quaint child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you say that you didn&#8217;t have all the
money you wanted?&#8221; inquired Tania anxiously.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that people like you ever needed
money. I thought that all poor people lived in
slums and took in washing like old Sal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge laughed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose the people
in the tenements are as poor as we are sometimes,
Tania, because they don&#8217;t need so many
things. But don&#8217;t worry your head about me,
little Fairy Godmother. I am sure that you
will bring me good luck.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Madge, I am afraid that you and the
girls are not having as good
a time at Cape May as I had hoped
you would have,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Curtis to the
little captain about a week later as they strolled
along the beautiful ocean boulevard that overlooked
the sea. Only the day before Mrs. Curtis
and Tom had returned from Chicago. Just
behind them, Lillian, Miss Jenny Ann, Phyllis,
Tom Curtis and Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s protégé, Philip
Holt, loitered along the beach. They were too
far away to overhear the conversation of the
two women.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, we are having a perfectly
beautiful time,&#8221; answered Madge, her face radiant
with the pleasure of her surroundings. &#8220;I
think Cape May is one of the loveliest places in
the whole world! And we girls have met the
most splendid old sea captain. He has the dearest,
snuggest little house up the bay! He was
once a deep-sea diver and knows the most fascinating
stories about the treasures of the sea.&#8221;
Madge ceased speaking. She could tell from
her friend&#8217;s slightly bored expression that Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Curtis was not interested in the story of a common
sailor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Madge, I know about all that,&#8221; Mrs.
Curtis returned a little coldly. &#8220;What I meant
is that I fear you girls are not enjoying the social
life of Cape May, which is what I looked
forward to for you. I do wish, dear, that you
cared more for society and less for such people
as this old sailor and a tenement child like
Tania. I doubt if this man is a fit associate for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s blue eyes darkened. She thought of
the splendid old sailor, with his great strength
and gentle manners, his knowledge of the world
and his fine simplicity, and of queer, loving little
Tania, but she wisely held her peace. &#8220;I am
sorry, too, that I don&#8217;t like society more if you
wish it,&#8221; she replied sweetly. &#8220;I do like the
society of clever, agreeable people, but not&mdash;I
like Ethel Swann and her friends immensely,&#8221;
she ended. &#8220;And, please, don&#8217;t say anything
against my old pearl diver, Mrs. Curtis, until
you see him. I am sure that you and Tom will
think that he is splendid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis looked searchingly at Madge, and
Madge returned her gaze without lowering her
eyes. Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s face softened. She found
it hard to scold her favorite, but she had been
very much vexed at the story that Philip Holt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
had repeated to her of Madge&#8217;s escapades at
Cape May, and how she accused Roy Dennis of
cowardice when he had taken her and her
friends on his boat after Madge&#8217;s and Phil&#8217;s
own heedlessness had caused their skiff to be
overturned. Somehow, the tale of the throwing
of the ball on board Roy Dennis&#8217;s yacht and of
frightening Mabel Farrar had also gone abroad
in Cape May. Lillian had confided the anecdote
to Ethel Swann under promise of the greatest
secrecy. The story had seemed to Ethel too ridiculous
to keep to herself, so she had repeated
it to another friend, after demanding the same
promise that Lillian had exacted from her. And
so the story had traveled and grown until it was
a very mischievous tale that Philip Holt had recounted
to Mrs. Curtis, taking care that Tom
Curtis was not about when he told it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis thought Madge too old for such
practical jokes. She also believed that Madge
should have more dignity and self-control. She
loved her very dearly, and she wished her to
come to live with her as her daughter after her
own, daughter, Madeleine, had married, but
Mrs. Curtis was determined that the little captain
should learn to be less impetuous and more
conventional.</p>
<p>&#8220;Philip Holt has told you something about
me, hasn&#8217;t he, Mrs. Curtis?&#8221; asked Madge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
meekly, hiding the flash in her eyes by lowering
her lids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Philip told me very little. He is the soul of
honor,&#8221; answered Mrs. Curtis quickly. &#8220;You
are absurdly prejudiced against him. But with
the little that he told me and what I have gathered
from other sources, I feel that you have
been most indiscreet. I can&#8217;t help thinking that
the various things that have happened may be
laid at your door, and that the other girls have
just stood by you, as they always do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge bit her lips. &#8220;Whatever has occurred
that you don&#8217;t like is my fault, Mrs. Curtis,&#8221; she
confessed, &#8220;and Phil, Lillian and Nellie <i>have</i>
stood by me. I am sorry that you are angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other young people were coming closer.
Not for worlds would Madge have had them
overhear her conversation with Mrs. Curtis.
She was too proud and too hurt to ask Mrs. Curtis
just what Philip Holt had said against her.
Neither would she retaliate against him by telling
her friend of his rudeness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis put one arm about Madge. &#8220;It is
all right, my dear,&#8221; she said, softening a little,
&#8220;but you must promise me that you will not do
such harum-scarum things again, and that you
will try to keep your temper.&#8221; Mrs. Curtis was
on the point of asking Madge to give up her acquaintance
with the sailor and not to see the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
man again, but she knew that her young friend
was feeling a little hurt and no doubt resentful
toward her, so she put off making her request
until a later time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tania has behaved very well, so far, hasn&#8217;t
she, Madge?&#8221; Mrs. Curtis tactfully changed
the subject. &#8220;I confess I am surprised. Philip
Holt assured me that the child was continually
in mischief in the tenement neighborhood where
she lives. When he took her into the neighborhood
house to try to help her she positively stole
something. I am afraid Tania&#8217;s mother was not
the woman you think she was; she was only a
cheap little actress, a dancer.&#8221; Mrs. Curtis
glanced at her companion. Madge was eyeing
her seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t like you, Mrs. Curtis, dear, to
say things against people. Philip Holt must
have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Madge stopped abruptly. At the
same time Tom Curtis came up from behind to
join his mother and the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Madge, and have a race with me
across the sands,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Mother will be
trying to make you so grown-up that we can&#8217;t
have any sport at all. Besides, you are looking
pale. I am sure you need exercise. There is a
crowd over there in front of the music pavilion.
I will wager a five-pound box of candy that I
can beat you to it. Philip Holt will entertain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
Mother. She likes him better than she does the
rest of us, anyhow, because he devotes his time
to good works and to working good people,&#8221;
added Tom teasingly, under his breath.</p>
<p>While Tom was talking Madge darted off
across the sands. She never would get over her
love of running, she felt sure, until she was old
and rheumatic. The color came back to her
cheeks and the laughter to her eyes.</p>
<p>Tom was close behind her. &#8220;Madge Morton,
you didn&#8217;t give me a fair start,&#8221; he protested,
&#8220;you rushed away before I was ready. I
thought you always played fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge dropped into a walk. &#8220;I do try to,
Tom,&#8221; she answered more earnestly than Tom
had expected. His remark had been made only
in fun. &#8220;You believe in me, don&#8217;t you, Tom?&#8221;
she added pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now and forever, Madge, through thick and
thin,&#8221; answered Tom steadily.</p>
<p>They had now come up nearer the crowd of
people on the beach. Up on a grand stand a
band was playing an Italian waltz, and an eager
crowd had gathered, apparently to listen to the
music.</p>
<p>But the two young people soon saw that on
the hard sand a child was dancing. Tom stopped
outside the circle of watchers, but Madge
went forward into it. She had at once recognized
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
little Tania! Eleanor had been left on the
houseboat to take care of the child, but Eleanor
was now nowhere to be seen, and her charge had
wandered into mischief.</p>
<p>Tania was dancing in her most bewitching
and wonderful fashion. Madge could not help
feeling a little embarrassed pride in her. The
child was moving like a flower swayed by the
wind. She poised first on one foot, then on the
other, then flitted forward on both pointed toes,
her thin, eager arms outstretched, curving and
bending with the rhythm of the music. She
wore her best white dress, the pride of her life,
which Eleanor had lately made for her. On her
head she had placed a wreath of wild flowers,
which she must have woven for herself. They
were like a fairy crown on her dark head. With
the love of bright colors, which she must have
inherited from some Italian ancestor, she had
twisted a bright scarlet sash about her waist.</p>
<p>Again Madge saw that Tania was utterly unconscious
of the audience about her. She looked
neither to the right nor to the left, but straight
upward to the turquoise-blue sky.</p>
<p>How different Tania&#8217;s audience to-day from
the crowd of people that had watched her on the
street corner when Eleanor and Madge had first
seen her! Yet these gay society folk were even
more fascinated by the child&#8217;s wonderful art.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
They could better appreciate her remarkable
dancing.</p>
<p>Tania did not even see her beloved Madge,
who was silently watching her. Tania&#8217;s usually
pale cheeks glowed as scarlet as her sash. Unconsciously
the little girl&#8217;s movements were like
those of a butterfly, a-flutter with the joy of the
sunshine and new life.</p>
<p>The music stopped suddenly and with it Tania&#8217;s
dance ceased as abruptly. She stood poised
for a single instant on one dainty foot, with
her graceful arms still swaying above her flower-crowned
head. Her audience watched her
breathlessly, for the effect of the child&#8217;s grace
had been almost magical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that a wonderful performance?&#8221;
whispered Tom in Madge&#8217;s ear. &#8220;The child is
an artist! Where do you suppose she learned to
dance like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tania had come back to earth in a brief
second. To Madge&#8217;s mystification, Tania started
about among the people who had been watching
her performance with her small hands
clasped together like a cup.</p>
<p>The child courtesied shyly to a fat old lady.
Her gesture was unmistakable. The woman
rummaged in her chain pocket-book and dropped
a silver quarter into Tania&#8217;s outstretched hands.
The next onlooker was more generous. Tania&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
eyes shone as she felt the size and weight of a
big silver dollar.</p>
<p>Few people in the Cape May crowd knew who
Tania was, or whence she had come. They probably
thought that the object of the dance had
been to earn money.</p>
<p>For a few moments Madge had been paralyzed
by Tania&#8217;s peculiar actions. She did not realize
what they meant. In this lapse of time the
rest of their party joined them.</p>
<p>It was the expression on Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s face
that made Madge appreciate what Tania was
doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth is Tania about?&#8221; exclaimed
Lillian in puzzled tones. She saw the child
standing before a young man who was evidently
teasing her and refusing her request for money.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has been dancing like a monkey with a
hand organ,&#8221; answered Philip Holt scornfully.
&#8220;I am afraid Cape May people will hardly understand
it. It looks as though the young women
on the &#8216;Merry Maid&#8217; were in need of
money.&#8221; The young man laughed as though
his last remark had been intended for a joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;None of that talk, Holt.&#8221; Madge caught
Tom&#8217;s angry tone as she hurried forward to
Tania. The little captain could have cried with
mortification and embarrassment. In the crowd
of curious onlookers she caught sight of Mabel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Farrar&#8217;s and Roy Dennis&#8217;s sneering faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tania!&#8221; she cried sharply. &#8220;What in the
world are you doing? Stop taking that money
at once!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tania glanced around and discovered Madge.
Instead of looking ashamed of herself, the
child&#8217;s face grew radiant. &#8220;Madge,&#8221; she cried,
in a high voice that could be heard all about
them, &#8220;it is all for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tania rushed forward with her outstretched
hands overflowing with silver.</p>
<p>Madge could have sunk through the sands for
shame. Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s face flamed with anger
and chagrin. She might have been able to explain
to her friends that Tania was only a street
child and knew no better than to dance for
money; but how could she ever explain the remark
to Madge? It looked as though Madge
had been a party to Tania&#8217;s dancing and begging.</p>
<p>Madge was overcome with embarrassment and
humiliation. She knew that she must, for the
minute, appear like a beggar to the crowd of
Cape May people. For just that instant she
would have liked to repulse Tania, to have
thrust the child and her money away from her
before every one. But a glance at Tania&#8217;s
eager, happy face restrained her. She put her
arm protectingly about the little girl, hiding her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
in the shelter of her body. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want the
money, Tania,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
right for you to have taken it from these people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want it?&#8221; faltered Tania. &#8220;I
thought you said last night that you and
Eleanor were very poor, and that you needed
some money very much. All the time I was in
bed last night I thought of what your Fairy
Godmother could do to help you. I know how to
do but one thing&mdash;to dance as my mother taught
me. How can it be wrong to take the money
from people? I have often done it in New York.
They only gave it to me because they liked my
dancing.&#8221; Madge could feel Tania&#8217;s hot tears
on her hands.</p>
<p>She clasped Tania closer. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t exactly
wrong, Tania; I was mistaken. It was just different.
I will have to explain it to you afterward.
Now we must give the money back to the
people again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding tight to Tania&#8217;s hand, Madge walked
among the group of strangers, explaining Tania&#8217;s
actions as best she could without hurting
the little girl&#8217;s feelings. It was one of the hardest
things that the proud little captain had ever
been called upon to do. But a part of the crowd
had scattered. It was not possible to find them
all and return their silver. Tania was too puzzled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and heart-broken to continue her errand
long. She did not understand why Madge had
refused to take her gift, which she thought she
had fairly earned. Finally she could hold back
her sobs no longer. Dropping her few remaining
nickels and dimes on the sand she broke
away from Madge&#8217;s clasp and ran like a little
wild creature away from everyone.</p>
<p>Madge stopped for just a second among her
friends before following Tania.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Madge,&#8221; remarked Mrs. Curtis
coldly, &#8220;Tania is quite impossible. I knew the
child would get you into difficulties, and it is just
as I feared. She must be sent away at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Madge shook her head with a decision
that was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she answered quietly, &#8220;Tania shall
not be sent away. None of you understand, and
I can&#8217;t explain it to you now, but Tania thought
she was doing something for Nellie and me. She
was foolish, of course, and I will see that she
never does it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>With her head held high, Madge hurried away
in pursuit of her Fairy Godmother.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;THE ANCHORAGE&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Madge was alone in the &#8220;Water Witch,&#8221;
which had been mended and was as
good as new. She had just come from
an interview with Mrs. Curtis, in which she had
tried to make her friend understand the reason
for Tania&#8217;s behavior of the day before. Mrs.
Curtis, however, would not take the little captain&#8217;s
view of the matter. She dwelt on the fact
that Tania had slipped away from the houseboat
without letting Eleanor know of it, and
that she was a naughty and disobedient child.</p>
<p>Madge also believed that Mrs. Curtis no
longer loved her so dearly as in the early days
of their acquaintance. The young girl was sure
that some influence was being brought to bear to
prejudice her friend against her. But what
could she do? Philip Holt was trying to destroy
the affection Mrs. Curtis felt for Madge
in order to ingratiate himself. It looked as
though he were going to succeed. Madge was
too proud to ask questions or to accuse Philip
Holt with deliberately trying to influence her
friend against her. Although she was only a
young girl, she realized that love does not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
amount to very much in this world unless it has
faith and sympathy behind it. So long as she
had done nothing she knew to be wrong, and for
which she should make an apology, she could
only wait to see if Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s affection would
be restored to her or cease altogether.</p>
<p>As usual, when she was troubled, the impulse
came to her to be alone on the water. She had
explained to Miss Jenny Ann that she might be
gone for several hours, so there was no immediate
reason why she should return to the houseboat.
The other girls were yachting with some
Cape May friends.</p>
<p>Madge rowed her boat up the bay toward the
home of the old sailor. She was not far from
the very place where Captain Jules had rescued
Tania and her a short while before. She thought
of the strange-looking beam sticking up out of
the sandy bottom of the bay on which Tania&#8217;s
dress had caught. It had certainly looked like
the broken mast of an old ship. She determined
to ask Captain Jules if any wrecks had recently
occurred near that part of the bay, and concluded
that she would row up to the sailor&#8217;s
house for the express purpose of asking him
this question. Of course, this was only an excuse.
She was deeply anxious to call on the old
sailor again and, if possible, persuade him to
keep his promise to her to show her his diving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
suit, and to tell her more of his strange experiences
at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Captain Jules was sitting in his favorite place
on the big rock just by the water in front of his
house. He was mending the sail of his fishing
boat.</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s boat came round a slight curve in the
bay, dancing toward him. This time Captain
Jules spied his guest and saluted her as he would
have greeted a superior officer.</p>
<p>The little captain blushed prettily as she returned
his salute in her best naval fashion.</p>
<p>The old captain looked hurriedly toward his
small house. There was no sight or sound of
any one about. He seemed uncomfortable for a
moment, then his face cleared. His deep blue
eyes gleamed and his mouth set squarely. &#8220;Coming
ashore to make me a call, Miss Madge?&#8221; he
asked invitingly.</p>
<p>Madge nodded. &#8220;If I shan&#8217;t be in your way.
You must let me just sit there on the rock by
you. I have been reading a perfectly thrilling
book about pearl-divers,&#8221; she announced as
soon as she was comfortably settled, &#8220;but none
of the stories were as thrilling as the ones you
told us. The book said that pearls had been
found in New Jersey. I wonder if you have
ever thought of diving down to the bottom of
this bay to see if it holds any treasures?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>The sailor was studying the girl&#8217;s face so earnestly
that he forgot to answer her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I have thought of it,&#8221; he replied a
little later, smiling at his guest. &#8220;A man never
wholly forgets his trade. But what a taste you
have for sea yarns, little lady! I half-way
think, now, that if you had not been born a girl
you might have followed the sea for your calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have loved it best of anything in the
world,&#8221; answered Madge fervently, gazing at
the beautiful expanse of sunny, blue water. &#8220;I
never feel as much at home anywhere as I do on
the sea. You see,&#8221; she continued confidingly,
&#8220;I have a reason for loving the water. My
father was a sailor. He was a captain in the
United States Navy once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A captain in the United States Navy,&#8217;&#8221;
Captain Jules repeated huskily. &#8220;I thought so.
I thought so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Madge wonderingly.</p>
<p>Captain Jules pulled his needle slowly
through a heavy piece of sail cloth. It must have
stuck, he was so long about it, and his big hands
fumbled it so clumsily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because of your liking for the water,
Miss Madge,&#8221; he returned quietly. &#8220;You see,
there are two great loves born in the hearts of
men and women that you never can get away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
from. The one is the love of the soil and the
other is the love of the sea. No matter what
your life is, if you have those two passions in
you, you&#8217;ve got to get back to the country or to
the water when your chance comes. But why
do you say that your father was once a captain
in the United States Navy? Is he dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid so,&#8221; replied Madge faintly. Of
late she was beginning to believe that her uncle
and aunt, Mrs. Curtis and all her older friends
were right. If her father were not dead in all
these long years, surely he would have tried to
find her. He would have sought to discover
some news of the daughter whom he had left
when she was only a baby.</p>
<p>Captain Jules seemed about to say something,
then, changed his mind. He shook his great,
shaggy, gray head and looked at Madge tenderly.
&#8220;Is your mother living?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she died soon after my father went
away to join his ship on his last voyage,&#8221; Madge
went on sadly, her eyes filling with tears. She
was half tempted to tell the old sailor her father&#8217;s
story, then decided to reserve it until some
future day when she felt that she knew him better.
In spite of her liking for the old sea captain,
she realized that she had hardly known
him long enough to make him her confidant.</p>
<p>Captain Jules continued to sew. He opened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
his mouth, to speak once or twice and then closed
it again. Finally he asked Madge huskily,
&#8220;What was your father&#8217;s name, child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Robert Morton,&#8221; replied Madge
slowly. &#8220;He was from Virginia. If I knew him
to be alive, I&#8217;d be the happiest girl in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules cast a peculiar glance in her direction
which Madge did not see.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear little mate,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;some
day a young man will come along who will be far
more to you than any old father could have
been. But what made your father go away? If
he was a captain in the Navy, what made him resign
his command?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that to-day, Captain Jules.
Perhaps I&#8217;ll tell you some day when I know you
better; in fact, I am sure I shall tell you. Perhaps
when I do tell you I shall ask you to do me
a great favor. Perhaps I shall ask you to help
me hunt for him. I&#8217;ll tell you a secret. Uncle
and Aunt have been good to me and I love them
dearly, but I want my own father, and I can&#8217;t, I
won&#8217;t, believe he is dead. That is, not until I
have absolute proof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girl!&#8221; exclaimed Captain Jules in
such a strange voice that Madge was startled,
&#8220;I promise you that I&#8217;ll help you find him.&#8221;
Then in a calmer tone of voice he said: &#8220;I told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
you that I would show you my diver&#8217;s suit. If
you will wait on my porch I will go around inside
the house to see if I can find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose hastily and disappeared into the
house, leaving Madge to wonder why the few
words she had spoken concerning her father had
affected the old sea captain so strangely.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII</h2>
<h3>TANIA&#8217;S NEMESIS</h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Jules was gone a long time,
but Madge did not mind waiting for
him. She loved the odd house with its
roof shaped like three sails and its restful name,
&#8220;The Anchorage.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Captain Jules came back with the great
suit his face was pale, almost haggard, but he
was smiling good-humoredly. &#8220;Come, stand
over here by this window while I show you my
old togs. I haven&#8217;t looked at this diving suit
myself for several years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge was too much interested in the diving
dress to glance in at the captain&#8217;s window to see
if she could catch a glimpse of the inside of the
snug little house that she had not yet been invited
to enter.</p>
<p>The diving suit was much lighter than she had
expected to find it. It weighed only about
twenty pounds. It was made of water-proof
material and had a large helmet of copper with
great circular glasses in front that looked like
goggle eyes.</p>
<p>Captain Jules explained that there were two
lines with which the diver communicated with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
the outside world. The one was the air line, and
it was used to pump air down to the man below
in the water. The life line was usually hitched
around the diver&#8217;s waist. This line was let out
to any depth the diver required, and by pulling
on it the diver could signal to the men who followed
his course: one jerk, pull up; two, more
air; three, lower the bag. Madge was utterly
fascinated with the netted bag, made of rope,
that Captain Jules showed her. He told her that
the pearl-diver always carried a bag to hold the
treasures that he finds at the bottom of the sea.
To her vivid imagination, the empty bag was
even now filled with shining pearls, the rarest
treasures of the sea.</p>
<p>The young girl persuaded Captain Jules to let
her dress up in his diver&#8217;s suit, when she stumbled
about the veranda in it, her gay laughter
mingling with the captain&#8217;s deep chuckles of
delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Captain Jules!&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;do take
me down to the bottom of the sea with you. I
have always wanted to be a mermaid, and this
may be the only chance I shall ever have. &#8216;Only
divers know of things below, of water&#8217;s green
and fishes&#8217; sheen,&#8217;&#8221; she chanted gayly.</p>
<p>The old sea captain gazed at Madge, breathing
a deep sigh of satisfaction. &#8220;I believe you have
the courage to do it if I were to let you try,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
murmured. &#8220;It comes nearer to convincing me
than anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Jules,&#8221; continued the girl earnestly,
&#8220;please, please let&#8217;s go down to the bottom
of this bay. You could take me with you and
then there wouldn&#8217;t be any danger. We have
been down together without diving suits and
here we are safe and sound on land again! You
said you thought there might be pearls in the
oyster beds of this bay. We could look, at any
rate. I saw the most wonderful things when I
was searching for Tania. It seemed as though
her dress was caught on the broken spar of an
old ship, though, of course, I couldn&#8217;t be sure.
Have there been many wrecks in this bay? Do
you suppose it was a ship&#8217;s spar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are always wrecks on the water, child.
And you mustn&#8217;t be talking nonsense about diving
down in this bay along with me,&#8221; answered
Captain Jules severely. He kept his eyes fastened
on his diving suit with an affectionate
gleam in them. &#8220;Maybe, though, I will make a
diving party of one and go down in the bay
alone. I&#8217;d give you the pearls I found down
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head. &#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t be
fair,&#8221; she said, setting her red lips together obstinately.
Captain Jules, she felt sure, would
be easy to manage. If he did any diving in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
Delaware Bay within the next few weeks, he
must take her with him.</p>
<p>She wrote secretly to New York City to ask
what a diver&#8217;s suit would cost. She was discouraged
by the answer, but she did not give up
hope. She was also very careful not to let Miss
Jenny Ann or Mrs. Curtis know anything of
the wild scheme that was evolving in her head.</p>
<p>Almost every day the girls saw Captain Jules.
Either they went up the bay to call on him, or he
made a visit to the houseboat.</p>
<p>The old captain never invited the girls inside
his house, but they had great frolics in his tidy
yard. The captain explained that his house was
not neat enough to be seen by young ladies, as it
had only a man housekeeper.</p>
<p>Even Mrs. Curtis became a little less prejudiced
against Captain Jules. She could not but
confess that he was a fine old man, though she
still did not see why Madge was so much attracted
by him. But the girl bided her time.
The four girls and their friends went off on long
fishing trips with Captain Jules. Sometimes
Mrs. Curtis, Tom, and their guest, Philip Holt,
went with them. The enmity between Madge
and Philip increased every day, nor did Madge
any longer make much effort to conceal her dislike
for him.</p>
<p>Philip Holt had a special reason for his dislike
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
for Madge Morton. He had come to Cape
May with the idea of making Mrs. Curtis do an
important favor for him upon which his whole
future depended. He feared that Madge, who
looked upon him as a hypocrite, would find out
his true character, tell her friend, and thus ruin
his prospects.</p>
<p>A singular misfortune had befallen him. Who
could have guessed that one of the few people
who knew his real history, Tania, the little street
child, would be picked up by the houseboat girls
and brought to Cape May for the summer? Tania
must not be allowed to betray him. If she
did, Mrs. Curtis must not believe either Madge
or Tania. The young man had to lay his plans
carefully, but he was a born hypocrite and he
meant to accomplish his end.</p>
<p>His first opportunity to further his cause
came one morning when he and Mrs. Curtis
were sitting on the veranda of her summer cottage.
Tom had gone out sailing and was not expected
back for several hours, so that Philip believed
that the coast was clear. He began by
telling Mrs. Curtis something of the charity
work that he had recently done in New York
City and so brought the subject about to Tania.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear Mrs. Curtis, you are so generous,&#8221; the
young man said admiringly. &#8220;I have just learned
that after the summer holiday is over you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
intend to send Miss Morton&#8217;s protégé, Tania,
to a boarding school. It is so kind in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis shook her head. &#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she
answered, &#8220;it is very little to do. Really, I
don&#8217;t see what else could be done with the child.
She is very queer and not attractive to me, but
Madge is fond of her and, as I am very fond of
Madge, I shall do what is best for the little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; murmured Philip Holt vaguely, &#8220;but
do you feel sure that a boarding school is the
best place for the girl? She is so unruly, so untruthful!
I fear that she would give you a great
deal of trouble and responsibility unless she
were placed under greater restraint. I have
wondered for some time what should be done
for the child. She has caused a lot of mischief
among the children on the street in her tenement
section. It seems to me that she ought to
be sent to some kind of an institution where she
would be more closely watched&mdash;an asylum or
home for incorrigible children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis looked worried and bit her lips.
&#8220;That is rather hard on the child, isn&#8217;t it? Still,
I could not undertake to be responsible for Tania&#8217;s
good behavior at school. She seems very
hard to control. I will watch her more closely,
and, if she shows more signs of untruthfulness,
I shall have to consider your suggestion.
However, I will talk the matter over with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
Madge. I wish you would walk down to the
houseboat for me and invite the girls to come up
to the hotel for luncheon. I hope they are not
off somewhere with Captain Jules. He seems to
claim the greater share of their attention
lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip Holt walked off, very well pleased with
his interview. He had conveyed to Mrs. Curtis
precisely the impression he had intended to convey.</p>
<p>Ever since his arrival at Cape May Philip
Holt had wished to see little Tania alone. He
had warned the child that she was not to behave
as though she had ever seen him before, yet he
was still afraid that she might make a confidante
of Madge. He needed to make his threat
to her more terrifying. He decided to find her
and intimidate her so thoroughly that she would
not dare betray her previous acquaintance with
him.</p>
<p>There was but one person in the world of
whom the queer, elf-like Tania was afraid. That
person was Philip Holt! She had feared him
since the day of her own mother&#8217;s death, and
the very thought of him was enough to fill her
childish soul with terror.</p>
<p>Tania was playing alone on the sands near that
houseboat at the time Mrs. Curtis and Philip
Holt were discussing her future. Madge and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Miss Jenny Ann were inside the houseboat,
within calling distance of Tania, but not where
they could see her. The little girl had just built
a house of shining pebbles and was gazing at it
with a pleased smile when she heard a step near
her on the sand. Tania stared up at Philip&#8217;s
thin, blonde face in terror-stricken silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tania,&#8221; the young man asked harshly,
&#8220;have you told any one down here that you
have ever seen or known me before?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tania shook her head mutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, if you do, I am going to have
you shut up in a big house with iron bars at the
windows where you can never go out or see your
friends any more,&#8221; Philip Holt went on, keeping
his voice lowered to a whisper.</p>
<p>Slowly Tania&#8217;s black eyes dropped. She tried
to be brave and to pretend that she did not care,
but the loss of her freedom was the one thing
that Tania feared with all her soul. If she were
shut up somewhere, how could she ever talk to
her fairies, or see the blue sky that she so loved?
And now, to be parted from the girls forever
was too dreadful! Indeed, she would not dare
to tell what she knew. Philip Holt was sure
of it.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Madge slipped out
on the houseboat deck to see if Tania were all
right. To her surprise she saw that Philip Holt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
was talking to the little girl. She had not
thought that Philip Holt cared enough for children
to waste a minute&#8217;s time with them. She
therefore wondered at his sudden interest in
Tania. Madge walked quietly off the houseboat.
She was wearing tennis shoes and her softly-shod
feet made no sound. She caught one
glimpse of Tania&#8217;s mute, white face and stopped
short in time to hear Philip say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you do tell that old Sal is my mother,
Tania, no one will believe you. She herself
will deny it and help me to have you shut up,&#8221;
declared Philip Holt menacingly.</p>
<p>Madge caught each word as though it had been
addressed to her. For Tania&#8217;s sake, and because
she knew that for many reasons it was
wiser, she held her peace for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Holt?&#8221; she asked innocently.
&#8220;I just saw you from the deck of the
houseboat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philip Holt leaped to his feet. But Madge&#8217;s
eyes were so clear and serene, her face so calm,
that it was utterly impossible she could have
overheard him.</p>
<p>Philip delivered Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s message and
then left the two girls together. Madge dropped
down on the sands by Tania and put her arm
about her. &#8220;You need never tell me who Mr.
Holt is, nor why you are afraid of him, Tania,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
she whispered; &#8220;I overheard what he said, and
you need not be afraid. I will take care of
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the Wicked Genii,&#8221; faltered Tania,
&#8220;who hated the Princess and wanted to drive
her away from her kingdom in Fairyland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he can&#8217;t harm you, Tania, dear,&#8221; comforted
Madge. &#8220;He dare not try to take you
away from us. I am going to tell Mrs. Curtis
all about this Wicked Genii and if I&#8217;m not mistaken
it will be he, not you who is sent away.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN JULES MAKES A PROMISE</h3>
</div>

<p>Little by little Madge was able to put together
the whole story of Philip Holt&#8217;s
life. He was old Sal&#8217;s son, and &#8220;Holt&#8221;
was not his own name, but he rarely came near
his mother, never gave her any help, and denied
his relationship with her whenever it was necessary.
When Philip Murphy was a small boy,
he had been taken into the home of a wealthy
family named Holt, but he had never been legally
adopted as their child. He was raised in
luxury and had made a great many wealthy
friends, and he had learned to love money more
than anything else in the world. But his rich patrons
would not allow him entirely to desert his
own mother. Twice every month he was made to
go to see old Sal Murphy in her tenement home
on the East Side. Philip Holt, who now went by
the name of his foster parents, fairly loathed
these visits. It was because of his hatred of
them that he began to take his spite out on Tania
when he was a lad of about fifteen, and poor Tania
a baby of only six years old.</p>
<p>Tania&#8217;s mother had died in the same tenement
where old Sal lived. There had been no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
one who wanted the little girl, so old Sal had
taken her, beaten and starved her, and made her
useful in any way that she could.</p>
<p>When Philip Holt had grown to manhood his
foster parents lost most of their money. A little
later they died, leaving their foster son nothing.
The young man had been used to luxury
and rich friends, and he could not give them up,
therefore he told his wealthy friends that because
he had once been a poor boy he meant to
devote his life to charity. He proposed to work
among the New York poor and asked their cooperation.
Large sums of money were given
him to be used for charity, but Philip Holt believed
too strongly in the theory that charity begins
at home. Whenever it was possible he used
a part of this money for himself. To make
more, he began speculating in Wall Street. He
lost two thousand, then five thousand dollars of
the money that had been entrusted to him. For
almost a year he had been the treasurer of a
New York charitable organization, and the time
was near at hand when he must give a report of
the money that he had misused. He knew that
disgrace, imprisonment, stared him in the face
unless he could persuade Mrs. Curtis to advance
him five thousand dollars for some charitable
purpose, or give it to him for himself. He, therefore,
did not intend to be balked in his plan by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
either Madge or Tania, no matter what desperate
measures he had to employ.</p>
<p>So there were two persons at Cape May who
came to believe that they stood in dire need of
money. Yet they wished it for very different
reasons: Philip Holt wanted money to save
himself from disgrace; Madge desired it to help
her uncle and aunt save their old home, &#8220;Forest
House,&#8221; to send Eleanor back to graduate at
Miss Tolliver&#8217;s in the fall, to start on her search
for her father, and, last of all, to take care of
Tania.</p>
<p>For Madge had managed the little waif&#8217;s affairs
most undiplomatically. When she discovered
the threat that Philip held over Tania if
she told his secret, the little captain went to
Mrs. Curtis with the story. She did not wish
her friend to be deceived by the young man, so
she confided to Mrs. Curtis that Philip Holt,
who was supposedly the son of some old friends,
was really the child of old Sal of the tenements.
Mrs. Curtis thought that Madge must
be mistaken. She wrote to old Sal to ask her
if it were true. The Irish woman was devoted
to her son. She would have done anything in
the world not to disgrace him. She answered
Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s letter by declaring that Philip
Holt was no relative of hers, but a young man
whom she knew because of his kindness to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
poor. Mrs. Curtis was indignant. She insisted
that Tania had told Madge a falsehood, and that
Philip Holt was right in his opinion of Tania.
It would not be well to send the child to a school;
she should be put in some kind of an institution.
This, however, Madge was determined should
never happen. She had no money of her own,
nor did she know where she was to obtain the
means, but she made up her mind to find some
way to provide for her quaint little Fairy Godmother.</p>
<p>The morning after Madge&#8217;s disquieting talk
with Mrs. Curtis the four girls and Tania wandered
up the bay to spend the morning in the
woods near the water. Phyllis carried a book
that she meant to read aloud, Madge a box of
luncheon, and Eleanor and Lillian their sewing.
Tania skipped along with her hand in Madge&#8217;s.
John had promised to join them later in the day
if he returned in time from his trip on the
water.</p>
<p>The girls settled themselves under some trees
whence they could command a view of the land
and the bay. Madge lay down in the soft grass
and rested her head in her hands. She meant
to listen to Phil&#8217;s reading, not to puzzle over her
own worries. Phil&#8217;s book gave a thrilling account
of the early days in the Delaware Bay,
when it was the favorite cruising place for pirates.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
It was rather hard to believe, when the
girls gazed out on the smooth, blue water, that
it had once been the scene of so many fierce adventures
with pirates. Once a crew of seventy
men, belonging to the famous Captain Kidd, had
actually sailed up the Delaware Bay and frightened
the people of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Madge had forgotten to listen. She could
hear Phil&#8217;s voice, but not her words. The history
of piracy, of course, was very thrilling, but
Madge did not see how any long-ago dead and
buried pirates or their hidden treasures could
help her out of her present difficulties. She stood
in need of real riches.</p>
<p>A sailboat dipped across the horizon and
headed for the landing not far from where the
girls were sitting, but no one of them noticed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look ahoy! look ahoy!&#8221; a friendly voice
cried out from across the water.</p>
<p>Phyllis closed her book with a snap, Lillian
and Eleanor dropped their sewing, Tania ran
to the water&#8217;s edge, and Madge sat up.</p>
<p>It was Captain Jules who had hailed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my hearties, is this a summer camp?&#8221;
demanded the old sailor as his boat came near
the land. &#8220;I have been all the way to the houseboat
to find you. I have something to show
you.&#8221; Captain Jules&#8217;s broad face shone with
good humor. He was clad in his weather-beaten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
tarpaulins, and on his shoulder perched the
monkey.</p>
<p>Madge covered the sides of her curly head
with her hands. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t let the monkey
pull my hair this morning,&#8221; she pleaded as the
captain came up.</p>
<p>He tossed the monkey over to Tania, who cuddled
it affectionately in her arms, and began
talking softly to it.</p>
<p>Then Captain Jules seated himself on the
grass and the houseboat girls gathered about
him in a circle. He put one great hand in his
pocket. &#8220;I&#8217;ve some presents for you,&#8221; he announced,
trying to look very serious, but smiling
in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221; asked Lillian eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s telling,&#8221; returned the captain. &#8220;You
must guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shells,&#8221; said Tania quickly.</p>
<p>Captain Jules shook his head. &#8220;You&#8217;re
warm, little girl,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;but you haven&#8217;t
guessed right yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lillian sighed. &#8220;I never could guess anything,&#8221;
she remarked sadly. &#8220;Please do tell us
what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain relented and drew out of his
pocket a handful of what seemed to be either
oyster or mussel shells.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve brought some oysters for our luncheon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; guessed Eleanor. &#8220;You
must stay and eat them with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules chuckled. &#8220;Oysters are out of
season, child, and these are never good to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Madge had clapped her hands together
suddenly, her eyes shining. &#8220;You have been
down to the bottom of the bay, haven&#8217;t you,
Captain Jules? And you&#8217;ve found some
pearls!&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules shook his head. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
call them pearls, exactly. They&#8217;re too little and
too poor. But come, now; maybe they are seed
pearls. I went down under the water with the
men who were looking over the oyster beds yesterday.
Pearl oysters are not found in beds,
like the edible oysters, so I wandered around on
the bottom of the bay a bit and picked up these.&#8221;
The captain extended his great hand. Five
pairs of eager eyes peered into it. There lay
four nearly round, thick shells, horny and rough
with tiny little pearls embedded in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Pearls are angel&#8217;s tears&#8217;,&#8221; quoted Phil
softly.</p>
<p>Captain Jules seemed worried. &#8220;I searched
about everywhere in the bay, but I could only
find these four tiny pearls, and pretty lucky I
was to find them!&#8221; the sailor continued. &#8220;They
aren&#8217;t of much value, but I wanted to give them
to five girls, and that&#8217;s just the difficulty.&#8221; The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
captain looked at the houseboat party, which
now included Tania, as though he did not know
just what he should make up his mind to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s draw straws for them,&#8221; suggested
Eleanor sensibly.</p>
<p>Madge shook her head. &#8220;No; Captain Jules
is to give them to you and to leave me out. Remember,
some stranger gave me a handsome
pearl when I graduated. I have never had it
mounted.&#8221; Madge slipped her arm confidingly
through the old sea captain&#8217;s and gazed into his
face with her most earnest expression. &#8220;Captain
Jules is going to do something else for me;
he is going down to the bottom of the bay again
in his diving suit, and he is going to take me
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a ridiculous idea!&#8221; protested Eleanor.
&#8220;Just as though Captain Jules would
think of doing any such thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lillian laughed unbelievingly, but Phil&#8217;s face
was serious. &#8220;It would be awfully jolly,
wouldn&#8217;t it? There wouldn&#8217;t be any danger if
Captain Jules should take you. Do please take
Madge down with you, and then take me,&#8221; she
insisted coaxingly.</p>
<p>Captain Jules shook his head, but the little
captain observed that he did not look half so
shocked at the idea as he had the first time she
proposed it. This was encouraging.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>Phil took hold of one of the captain&#8217;s hands,
and Madge the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, please, <i>please</i>!&#8221; they pleaded in
chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Jenny Ann wouldn&#8217;t let you,&#8221; objected
Captain Jules faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if we were to get her permission,&#8221; argued
Madge triumphantly, &#8220;then you would
take us down to the bottom of the bay. I just
knew you would, you are so splendid! I shall
send to New York to see if we can rent a diving
suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that, I&#8217;ll see about the
suit,&#8221; promised Captain Jules. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all
nonsense, and I have never said that I would
take you. I wish I weren&#8217;t a sailor. There is
an old saying that a sailor can never refuse anything
to a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Tom,&#8221; announced Lillian hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t say anything to him about the
diving,&#8221; warned Madge. &#8220;He will think it is
perfectly dreadful for girls to attempt it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT ADVENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>The news that old Captain Jules Fontaine,
the retired pearl diver, whose history
was a mystery to most of the inhabitants
at Cape May, was to take Madge Morton down
to the bottom of Delaware Bay with him spread
through the town and seaside resort like wildfire.
It was in vain that the houseboat party
and Captain Jules tried to keep the affair a secret.
There were necessary arrangements to be
made, men to be engaged to assist in the diving
operations; it was impossible to deny everything.</p>
<p>At first the plan seemed to outsiders like mere
midsummer madness. Then the story began to
grow. Cape May residents learned that Captain
Jules had found pearls in the bottom of the bay.
No one would believe the captain&#8217;s statement
that the pearls were of little value; gossip
made the tiny pearls grow larger and larger,
until they were fit for an empress.</p>
<p>Captain Jules was besieged at his little house
up the bay, although, as usual, he kept the door
fastened against intruders. Half the fishermen
and oystermen in the vicinity begged to be permitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
to accompany the old sea diver in his
descent into the water. Captain Jules politely
explained that he needed no companions; he
was merely going on a diving expedition to
amuse two of his friends, Phyllis Alden and
Madge Morton, who had a taste for watery adventure.
He did not expect to find anything of
value in the bottom of the bay. They were going
down merely for sport.</p>
<p>There was one person at Cape May who listened
eagerly to any tale of the fabulous riches
that the old pearl diver was evidently expecting
to unearth. He was Philip Holt. The time of
his visit at Cape May was rapidly passing. Mrs.
Curtis was exceedingly kind and interested in
her guest, but Philip did not feel that he dared
approach her too abruptly with the request for
so large a sum of money as five thousand dollars.
Besides, Philip Holt knew that Tom Curtis
disliked him heartily. Tom was not likely
to approve a man whom Madge mistrusted; nor
would Mrs. Curtis give away or lend five thousand
dollars without first consulting her son.
So the marvelous tale of the pearls to be found
in the Delaware Bay rooted itself in Philip
Holt&#8217;s imagination. Here was another way to
get out of his scrape. He was not fond of adventure,
but he would do anything in the world
for money. Perhaps he could find pearls enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
not only to pay his debt, but to make him rich
forever afterward.</p>
<p>Quietly, and without a word to any one, Philip
Holt made a secret visit to the house of the three
sails. He implored Captain Jules to make him
his diving companion. He attempted to bribe
him with sums of money that he did not possess.
He even threatened the old sailor that he would
make investigations about his life and expose
any secrets that the captain might wish to keep.
Captain Jules only laughed at these threats.
He was not going down in the bay for treasures,
he declared. He expected to find absolutely
nothing of any value. Positively he would not
allow any one to accompany him but the two
girls.</p>
<p>Madge and Phyllis had a hard fight to persuade
Miss Jenny Ann to give her consent to
their plan for playing mermaid. But she was
getting so accustomed to the exciting adventures
of her girls that, when Captain Jules assured
her there was really no special danger, so long
as he kept a close watch on the diver with him,
she finally agreed to the scheme. Captain Jules
gave the two girls every kind of instruction in
the art of diving that he thought necessary, and
the day of the great watery adventure was set
for the week ahead.</p>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday, July 12th, Madge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
awoke at daybreak. She felt a delicious, shivery
thrill pass over her that was one part fear
and the other part rapture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil,&#8221; she whispered a few seconds later,
when she heard her chum stirring in the berth
above her, &#8220;can you feel fins growing where
your feet are? Your flop in the bed sounded
as though you were a real mermaid! Just think,
at ten o&#8217;clock sharp we are going down to explore
a new world! I wonder if there were
ever any girl divers before? You are awfully
good to let me go down first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not,&#8221; answered Phil soberly. &#8220;If
there is any danger, I am letting you go down
to it first. But I shall watch above the water,
with all my eyes, to see that everything goes
right. The captain has explained the whole
business of diving to us so thoroughly that I believe
I can tell if anything is wrong with you below
the surface. You&#8217;ll be careful, won&#8217;t you,
Madge? You know you are usually rather reckless.
Don&#8217;t stay down too long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Captain Jules won&#8217;t let me be reckless
this time. We are not going down into very
deep water, anyway, and a professional diver
can stay under several hours when the water
is only about five fathoms deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge and Phyllis ate a very light breakfast.
Captain Jules had told them that a diver must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
never go down into the water on a full stomach,
as it would make him too short-winded. While
the two prospective divers were eating poor
Miss Jenny Ann was wondering what had ever
induced her to give her consent to so mad an
enterprise as this diving.</p>
<p>Every effort had been made to keep a crowd
away from the pier from which Captain Jules
meant to send out the boats with the tenders,
who were the men to look after the safety of
Madge and himself.</p>
<p>As the girls came up, with Miss Jenny Ann, to
join Captain Jules they saw twenty or thirty
people about. Mrs. Curtis and Tom, accompanied
by Philip Holt, had come down to the
pier. Mrs. Curtis would hardly speak to Madge,
she was so angry at the risk she believed the little
captain was running. She and Madge had
not been very friendly since they had disagreed
so utterly in Madge&#8217;s report of the real character
and name of Philip Holt.</p>
<p>Madge and Phyllis each wore a close fitting,
warm woolen dress. Madge had tucked up her
red-brown curls into a tight knot. Her eyes
were glowing, but her face was white and her
lips a little less red when Captain Jules came
forward to fasten her into her diving suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t attempt it, Madge, if you are frightened,&#8221;
urged Miss Jenny Ann, who was feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
dreadfully frightened herself. &#8220;I am sure
Captain Jules will forgive you if you back out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules looked at Madge searchingly.
Her eyes smiled bravely into his, although her
heart was going pit-a-pat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Madge is not afraid,&#8221; answered Captain
Jules curtly. &#8220;Robert Morton&#8217;s daughter
has no right to know fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge first slipped her feet into a pair of
heavy leather boots. She gave a gay laugh as
she slipped into her rubber cloth suit, which was
made in one piece. &#8220;I feel just like a walrus,&#8221;
she confided to Tom Curtis, who was watching
her with set lips.</p>
<p>Then Madge and Captain Jules, who was in
exactly the same costume, got into their boats
and moved out a little distance from the shore.</p>
<p>Tom Curtis had asked Captain Jules&#8217;s consent
to sit in one of the boats with Phil. At the
last moment Philip Holt stepped calmly into the
other. No one stopped to argue with him, or to
thrust him out; the whole party was too much
excited.</p>
<p>Not for all the pearls in all the seas would
Captain Jules Fontaine have allowed one hair
of Madge&#8217;s head to be injured. But he really
did not believe that she would be in any danger
under the water with him. He had arranged
every detail of the diving perfectly. He would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
watch her every movement at the bottom of the
bay. To tell the truth, Captain Jules was immensely
proud of Madge&#8217;s and Phil&#8217;s bravery
in desiring to accompany him.</p>
<p>The final moment for the dive arrived. Madge
waved her hand to the crowd of her friends lining
the shore. She flung back her head and
looked gayly, triumphantly, up at the blue sky
above her, with its sweep of white, sailing
clouds. Below her the water looked even more
deeply blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, Madge,&#8221; whispered Captain
Jules calmly, &#8220;the one quality a diver needs
more than anything else is presence of mind.
Keep a clear head under the water and nothing
shall harm you, I swear. But above all, don&#8217;t
forget your signals.&#8221;</p>
<p>With his own hands Captain Jules fastened
the brass corselet about Madge&#8217;s slender neck
and set a big copper helmet which he screwed
over her head to her corselet. Madge then surveyed
the world only through the glass windows
at each side of her head and in front.
Her air-tube entered her helmet at the back.
Two men in one of the boats were to keep the
young girl diver supplied with oxygen by pumping
fresh air down through this tube.</p>
<p>A moment later Captain Jules stood rigged
in the same costume as Madge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, my girl,&#8221; Captain Jules warned
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, Captain,&#8221; returned Madge quietly,
&#8220;I&#8217;m ready. Let us go down together to the
bottom of the bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pump away,&#8221; ordered the captain.</p>
<p>There was a splash on the surface of the clear
water, a long-drawn gasp from Madge&#8217;s
friends; then a few bubbles rose. Rapidly, skillfully,
Madge&#8217;s tenders played out her life and
pipe lines, and Madge Morton disappeared from
the world of men. Captain Jules made his
plunge a few seconds in advance of his companion.</p>
<p>In the boat where Tom Curtis and Phyllis Alden
sat there was a breathless, intense silence.
The boy and girl happened to be in the boat with
the men who were looking out for the welfare
of Captain Jules. Philip Holt was with Madge&#8217;s
tenders.</p>
<p>Phyllis knew that there was but one way in
which she could follow her chum&#8217;s course below
the surface of the water. She could watch her
life and air lines. Captain Jules had made it
plain to Phyllis that all the time the diver is under
water small ripples will appear near his air
line. These bubbles are caused by the air that
the diver breathes out from the valve in the side
of his diving helmet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>Phyllis watched the lines doggedly. Captain
Jules was to keep Madge under water only about
fifteen or twenty minutes, but at that a minute
may appear longer than an hour.</p>
<p>Suddenly Phyllis Alden discovered that the
man who was tending Madge&#8217;s air pump seemed
to be working less vigorously. He pumped unevenly.
Once he swayed, as though he were
about to fall over in his seat.</p>
<p>In a second it flashed over Phyllis that the
man was ill. He was a strong, red-faced individual,
but his face turned to a kind of ghastly
pallor. It was all so quick that Phil had no time
to speak from her boat. Philip Holt, who was
in the same boat with the man, grasped the situation
as quickly as Phyllis did. With a single
motion he took the tender&#8217;s place at the air-pump.
Phil saw that he was pumping away
with vigor.</p>
<p>At this moment Phil turned to speak to Tom
Curtis. &#8220;Tom, how long have they been under
the water?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten minutes,&#8221; returned Tom, glancing hastily
at his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems ten hours,&#8221; murmured Phil, as
though she dared not speak aloud.</p>
<p>Tug, tug! Phil thought she saw Madge&#8217;s air
line give two desperate jerks. Two pulls at the
line was the diver&#8217;s signal for more air. Phil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
knew that without a doubt. Yet Philip Holt
seemed to be pumping vigorously. At least, he
had been only the second before when Phil last
looked at him.</p>
<p>Again Phil saw Madge&#8217;s air line jerk twice.</p>
<p>Tom Curtis and the two men in Captain
Jules&#8217;s boat were vainly trying to interpret
some signals that Captain Jules was making to
them. The two boats were at no great distance
apart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid something is the matter below,
Phil,&#8221; Tom Curtis turned to mutter hoarsely.
But Phyllis Alden, who had been sitting near
him a moment before, was no longer there.</p>
<p>Phyllis believed she saw that Philip Holt was
only pretending to pump sufficient air down to
Madge. She may have been wrong. Who could
ever tell? But Phil knew there was no time to
discuss the matter. One minute, two minutes,
five or ten&mdash;Phil did not know how long a diver
at the bottom of the water can be shut off from
his supply of fresh air and live. She did not
mean to wait, to ask questions, or to lose time.
Phil made a flying leap from the skiff that held
her to the one in which Philip Holt sat by the
air-pump. She landed in the water, just alongside
the boat. Quietly, though more quickly
than she had ever moved before in her life, Phil
climbed into the boat and thrust Philip Holt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
away from the air pump. In the minute it had
taken her to make her plunge she had seen
Madge&#8217;s signal again, but this time the line
jerked more feebly than it had before.</p>
<p>Phil set the pump to working again; the signal
answered from below, &#8220;All is well!&#8221;</p>
<p>The tender had recovered from his attack of
faintness and resumed his work at Madge&#8217;s
airline.</p>
<p>But Philip Holt sat crouched in the bottom of
the boat, his face white with anger. What would
Phyllis Alden&#8217;s action suggest but that he was
trying to suffocate Madge in the water below?</p>
<p>Whether or not Philip Holt meant to stifle
Madge Morton he himself never really knew.
The impulse came to him as he placed his hands
on her air-pump. It flashed across his mind that
it was Madge who had tried to injure his prospects
with Mrs. Curtis, and who had kept him
from going down with Captain Jules to search
for the pearls that he firmly believed would
be found at the bottom of the bay. It was while
these thoughts passed through Philip Holt&#8217;s
mind his pressure on Madge&#8217;s air-pump had
wavered. But Phyllis Alden had discovered it.
She gave him no opportunity either for action
or regret.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE PEARL</h3>
</div>

<p>Madge felt herself in a great fairy world
peopled with giants. Every thing below
the water is magnified a thousandfold.
Slowly she went down and down! The
fishes splashed and tumbled about her, hurrying
to get away from this strange, new sea-monster
that had come into their midst.</p>
<p>The little captain felt no mental sensation except
one of wonder and of awe; no physical impression
save a pressure as of a great weight on
her head and a roaring of mighty waters in her
ears. She no longer had any idea of being
afraid.</p>
<p>At the first plunge into the water she had shut
her eyes, but now, as she approached the bottom
of the bay, she kept them wide open.</p>
<p>The water was clear as crystal, like the reflection
in a mammoth mirror. She could see
nearly fifty feet ahead of her. Captain Jules
walked just in front of her, swinging his great
body from side to side, peering down into the
sandy bottom of the bay. Madge discovered
that the only way in which she could get a view,
except the one directly in front of her, was by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
turning her head inside her helmet, to look
through her side window glasses. The goggles
over her eyes gave her just the view that a
horse has with blinkers.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of things that Madge
would have liked to confide to Captain Jules.
However, for once in her life, she was compelled
to hold her tongue. Her eyes, her hands, and
her feet she could keep busy. Now and then she
gave a little ejaculation of wonder inside her
copper helmet at the marvels she saw. No one
heard her cry out. Captain Jules wasted no
time. He was exceedingly business-like. He
motioned to Madge just where she should go
and what she should do, and she obediently followed.</p>
<p>There were long, level flats of sand in the bottom
of Delaware Bay, like small prairies. Then
there were exquisite oases of waving green seaweed,
gardens of sea flowers and ferns, and hillocks
of rocks, with all sorts of queer sea animals,
crabs, jelly-fish, and devil-fish, scurrying
about them.</p>
<p>Caught in the moss, encrusted on the rocks,
sunken in the yellow sands, were opalescent,
shining shells and pebbles, each one more beautiful
than the last. Madge did not realize that
if she carried these shells and pebbles above the
water they would look like ordinary stones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Every now and then the young diver would
stoop and drop one of them in her netted bag
with a thrill of excitement.</p>
<p>Again and again Captain Jules had assured
Madge that she must not expect to find any
pearls of much value in Delaware Bay. There
were few pearls in edible oysters. The beds
about Cape May were meant to supply the family
table, not the family jewels. Of course, it
was true, the Captain admitted, that a pearl did
appear now and then in an ordinary oyster.
Yet this was an accident and most unlikely to
occur.</p>
<p>Madge had really tried not to believe that she
was going to find any kind of prize in the new
world under the water. In spite of all her efforts
she had been thinking and planning and
hoping. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps she would find a
pearl of great price. Then her troubles would
be at an end.</p>
<p>All this time Madge had been breathing naturally
and comfortably inside her helmet as she
traveled along the bed of the bay. She was so
unconscious of any difficulty that she was beginning
to believe that she was, in truth, a mermaid,
and that water, and not air, was her natural
element. Suddenly she felt a little uneasy,
as though the windows of her room had been
closed for too long a time. It was nothing, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
was sure. The stifling sensation would pass in
another second.</p>
<p>At this moment Captain Jules gazed hard at
Madge. He had never forgotten his charge for
a moment. But all seemed well with her, and
the captain thought he saw ahead of him something
that was well worth investigating. He
dropped on his knees in the soft mud. With
him he had a small hammer and a fork, not unlike
a gardener&#8217;s. Shining through some green
sea moss so soft and fine that it might have been
the hair of a water-baby, Captain Jules had espied
some glittering shells. To his experienced
eye the glow was that of mother-of-pearl. It is
the mother-of-pearl shell that usually covers the
precious pearl. The old sailor set to work.
Madge was eagerly watching him, when once
again the faint stifling sensation swept over her.
Surely it was not possible to faint in a diving
suit. Besides, Madge&#8217;s heart was beating so furiously
with excitement that it was small wonder
she could not get her breath. She believed
that Captain Jules was about to discover a wonderful
pearl. He had wrenched the shells free
and was trying to open them. Madge stood
some feet away from him, quivering with excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And the sea shall give up its treasures&#8217;,&#8221;
she quoted softly to herself as she watched.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>The next moment her hands made an involuntary
movement in the water. Had she been on
land her gesture would have meant that she
was fighting for breath. To her horror she realized
that she was slowly suffocating. Something
must have happened to her air-pump
above the water. She was not faint from any
other cause, but was getting an insufficient supply
of fresh air.</p>
<p>At this moment Madge proved her mettle.
She remembered Captain Jules&#8217;s injunction,
&#8220;Keep a clear head under the water and there
is nothing to fear.&#8221; She knew the signal for
more fresh air, and gave two hard, quick pulls
on her life line. Then she waited. Relief would
surely come in a moment.</p>
<p>For the first and only time since their descent
to the bottom of the bay Captain Jules had temporarily
neglected Madge. He certainly had
not expected to find any pearls in so unlikely a
place as Delaware Bay; yet the shells he held
in his hand were most unusual. The thrill of his
old occupation seized hold of the pearl fisher.
His big hands fairly trembled with emotion. He
felt, rather than saw, Madge jerk her life line
twice, but it never dawned on him that her signal
for more air might fail to be answered.</p>
<p>Madge signaled again. A loud buzzing
seemed to sound in her ears. Her tongue felt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
thick and swollen. She could not see a foot
ahead of her. All the dazzling, shimmering
beauty of the world under the water had passed
into blackness. The little captain&#8217;s eyes were
glazing behind the glass windows of her helmet.
She felt that she must be dying. But she had
strength to give one more signal. Air! air!
How could she ever have believed that there
was anything in the world so precious as fresh
air? Madge had a vision of a field of new-mown
hay in her old home at &#8220;Forest House.&#8221;
The wind was blowing through it with a delicious
fragrance. Had she the strength to pull her
life line once again? The water that she loved
so dearly was to claim her at last. She made a
motion to go toward Captain Jules, but she had
no control of her limbs.</p>
<p>Then Captain Jules became aroused to action.
He realized that Madge had signaled for air, not
once, but several times. This meant that her
signal had not been answered. The captain had
been for too many years a deep-sea diver not to
guess instantly the girl&#8217;s condition. The groan
inside his helmet came from the bottom of his
heart. Captain Jules&#8217;s hands shook. He dropped
the shells that he believed might contain
priceless pearls down into the soft sand in the
bed of the bay.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Tom Curtis and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
Phyllis Alden, as well as the captain&#8217;s boat tenders,
caught his confusing signals from below.
More fresh air was pumped down the tube to
Captain Jules, but not to Madge.</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s leap and quick work at Madge&#8217;s air-pump
must have taken place not more than
three minutes afterward, but they were horrible,
agonizing moments. Madge hardly knew how
they passed. Captain Jules suffered the regret
of a lifetime. How could he have been so unwise
as to entrust the safety of this girl, whose
life was so dear to him, to the perils of a diver&#8217;s
experiences? In the few weeks of their acquaintance
Madge Morton had become all in all
to Captain Jules Fontaine.</p>
<p>There was but one thing for Captain Jules to
do for his companion. He must signal to have
her drawn up to the surface of the water again,
trusting that she would not suffocate for lack of
air in her ascent.</p>
<p>Madge was near enough to lay her hand on
Captain Jules&#8217;s arm. Phil&#8217;s relief had come
just in time. The life-giving fresh air from the
world above pressed into her copper helmet. It
filled her nose and mouth, it poured into her
aching lungs. She received new life, new energy.
Now she was no longer afraid. She
did not wish to go above the surface of the
water. Surely all above was now well. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
yearned to continue her adventures on the under
side of the world.</p>
<p>She it was, not Captain Jules, who dropped
down on her hands and knees to grope for the
captain&#8217;s lost pearl shells.</p>
<p>But the sand had covered them up forever, or
else the water had carried them away!</p>
<p>Captain Jules wished to take Madge out of
the water immediately, yet he yielded for a minute
to her disappointment. What treasures had
they lost when he threw the mother-of-pearl
shells away? Neither of them would ever know.
The old diver looked about in the soft mud, while
Madge raked furiously near the spot where she
thought the sailor had dropped the shells. Captain
Jules walked on for a little distance. He
had seen beyond them a tangled mass of other
shells and seaweed and it occurred to him that
the water might have carried his shells into
some hidden crevice nearby.</p>
<p>But Madge never left her chosen spot. Deeper
and deeper she dug. What a swirl of mud arose
and eddied about her, darkening the clear water
in which she stood! The little captain&#8217;s hammer
struck against something hard. Was it a
rock embedded in the sand? Yet a distinct
sound rang out, as of one metal striking against
another!</p>
<p>Madge did not know how she summoned Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Jules back to her side. She was wild with
curiosity and excitement. Captain Jules was
smiling behind his copper mask. The young girl
diver had probably found a piece of old iron
cast off from some ship. Still, she should unearth
whatever she had discovered so near the
dark kingdom of Pluto.</p>
<p>The captain worked with her. Whatever her
find might be, it was larger and heavier than
Captain Jules had expected. They could afford
to spend no more time with it. It was time for
Madge to leave the water.</p>
<p>It is difficult to make an imploring gesture in
a diver&#8217;s suit. Yet, somehow, Madge must have
managed to do so. For one moment longer the
old pearl diver relented. The hole that they
were digging in the bottom of the bay was widening
before them. A chunk of what looked like
solid iron was visible. Then a triangular end
came into view. It was rusted until it shone like
beautiful green enamel. The top was absolutely
flat and of some depth, as it was so hard to excavate.</p>
<p>The time was growing short. Madge had been
under the water as long as was safe for any
amateur diver. The captain was a man to be
obeyed, as she knew instinctively. She gave one
more dig into the mud about her iron treasure.
It now became plain, both to her and to Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Jules, that she had found an old iron chest. The
captain tugged at it with both his great, strong
hands. It was strangely heavy. But he managed
to lift it in his arms.</p>
<p>Straightway he gave the signal to ascend;
three sharp tugs at his life line. Madge followed
suit. But she cast one long backward glance at
the watery world into which she might never
again descend, as slowly, steadily, the boat tenders
pulled up her long life line. Her feet dangled
above the sandy bottom of the bay. Now
she could see even farther off. About forty feet
from the rapidly filling hole from which she and
the captain had extracted the iron chest was a
spar of a ship jutting above the sand. The little
captain may have been wrong, but it looked
like the very spar on which Tania&#8217;s dress had
caught the day she was so nearly drowned.
Madge could not tell how far she and Captain
Jules had traveled on the bottom of the bay, but
she knew they had made their descent at a place
no very great distance from the spot where Roy
Dennis&#8217;s yacht had run down their skiff, and
Captain Jules had rescued Tania and herself.</p>
<p>Thought travels swifter than anything else in
the created world. So Madge&#8217;s thoughts had
reached the upper world before she followed
them. She wondered if the girls would be very
sadly disappointed when she returned bearing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
instead of a costly pearl, nothing but a rusted
iron box!</p>
<p>Would Phil have better luck when she descended
to the depths of the bay? What had
happened in the outside world since she had disappeared
from it a long, long time ago?</p>
<p>A flare of blinding sunlight smote across the
glass goggles in Madge&#8217;s copper helmet. She
felt herself picked up and lifted bodily into a
boat. Her helmet and corselet were unscrewed.
She lay still, smiling faintly as the boat made
for her friends who crowded, watching, on the
pier. Captain Jules, bearing the small iron
chest, landed a moment later. The little captain
had been in a new world, into which few men
and rarely any women have ever entered. She
had been out of her human element, a creature
of the water, not of the air, and it seemed to her
that she must have lived a whole new lifetime
as a deep-sea diver.</p>
<p>Tom Curtis stared anxiously at his watch
and smiled into her white face. He breathed a
sigh of relief and of wonder. Captain Jules
Fontaine and Madge Morton had been down at
the bottom of Delaware Bay exactly thirty minutes!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE FAIRY GODMOTHER&#8217;S WISH COMES TRUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Captain Jules decided to wait until
another day before taking Phyllis Alden
on the journey from which he and
Madge had just returned. The old sailor was
too deeply thankful to see his first charge safe
on land. Poor Miss Jenny Ann could do nothing
but lean over Madge and cry; the nervous
strain of waiting while the girl was under the
water had been too great. Indeed, even the people
who, Madge knew, were not in the least interested
in her, appeared dreadfully upset.
Philip Holt&#8217;s face was very pale and his eyes
shifted uneasily from Phyllis&#8217;s to Madge&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>Phyllis was the most self-possessed of the four
girls. She was greatly disappointed at the captain&#8217;s
determination to put off the time for her
diving expedition until a later date. But Phyllis
was always unselfish. She realized that her
chaperon and her friends had had about as
much anxiety as they could endure in one day.
Madge had been under the water, and she could
not dream of what the others had suffered
above, while awaiting her return.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis put her arms about the little captain
and embraced her with an affection she
had not shown her during the summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;will you ever
stop being the most reckless girl in the world?
What possible good could that wretched diving
feat of yours do anybody on earth? If my hair
weren&#8217;t already white I am sure it would have
turned so in the last half-hour. Look at poor
Philip Holt. He seems as nervous as though
you were his own sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge and Captain Jules had both taken off
their heavy diving suits and were soon shaking
hands with every one on the pier. Even Roy
Dennis and Mabel Farrar, much as they disliked
Madge, could not conceal the fact that they
thought her extremely plucky.</p>
<p>Captain Jules had laid the iron chest on the
ground and for the moment they had forgotten
it.</p>
<p>It was little Tania who danced up to it and
tried to lift it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show us the pearls you found, Madge,&#8221;
Eleanor begged her cousin at this instant, her
brown eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>The little captain looked crestfallen. &#8220;I am
afraid we didn&#8217;t find anything of value,&#8221; she
said, trying to pretend that she was not disappointed.
&#8220;I have only some pretty shells and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
stones that I gathered on the bottom of the bay
for Tania.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pulled her sea treasures out of her netted
diving bag. Sure enough, the water had
dried on them and the shells and stones appeared
quite dull and ugly. There were almost as
pretty shells and pebbles to be picked up at any
place along the Cape May beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Madge!&#8221; exclaimed Lillian, before she
realized what she was saying, &#8220;surely, you
didn&#8217;t waste your time in bringing up such silly
trifles as these?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head humbly. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t
find anything else but this old iron chest. Captain
Jules, may I take it back to the houseboat
with me as a souvenir, or do you wish it? Tania,
child, you can&#8217;t lift it, it is too heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Curtis brought the chest to Captain
Jules. Some of the crowd had moved away,
now that the diving was over. But a dozen or
more strangers pressed about the girls and their
friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something in this little chest, Captain,&#8221;
declared Tom Curtis quietly, as he set it
down before the captain and Madge. &#8220;I could
feel something roll around in the box as I lifted
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules shook the heavy safe. Something certainly
rattled on the inside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>There were bits of moss and tiny shells and
stones encrusted on the upper lid of the box.
Deliberately Captain Jules scraped them off
with a stick. The houseboat party and Tom
were beginning to grow impatient. What made
Captain Jules so slow? Philip Holt, who was
standing by Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s side, gazed sneeringly
at the operations. He was glad, indeed, that he
had not risked his life in descending to the bottom
of the bay in search for pearls, only to bring
up a rusty chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The box is fastened tightly; it will have to
be broken open,&#8221; remarked Madge indifferently.
She was feeling tired, now that the excitement
of her diving trip was over. She wished
to go home to the houseboat. She did not wish
Captain Jules to guess for an instant how disappointed
she was that they had found nothing
of value on their diving adventure. If only the
captain had not dropped the shells in which
there might have been a chance of finding
pearls!</p>
<p>Captain Jules had hold of the iron hammer
that he used when diving. Click! click! click!
he struck three times on the lock of the iron
safe. Like the magic tinder-box, the lid flew
open. Tania&#8217;s long-drawn childish, &#8220;Oh!&#8221; was
the only sound that broke the tense and breathless
stillness that pervaded the group.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>A single pearl! The scorned iron chest
almost full of shining coins and precious stones!
There were coins of gold and silver&mdash;strange
coins that no one in the watching crowd had
ever seen before. Some of them bore dates and
inscriptions of English mintings of the early
part of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Of course, it was incredible! No one believed
his eyes. A treasure-chest unearthed after more
than two hundred years? It was impossible!</p>
<p>Yet instantly each one of the girls remembered
that the pirates had sunk many vessels in
Delaware Bay in the latter part of the seventeenth
and the beginning of the eighteenth
century. In those days many wealthy English
families came over with their servants
and their treasure to settle in the new country
of America.</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s book on the history of piracy had recalled
this information to the girls only ten days
before. It was then, when Madge lay with her
head resting in her hands, looking dreamily out
over the waters, that she had wondered how
anything so remote from her as the story of the
early American battles with pirate ships could
help her to solve her present troubles? Yet
here, like a miracle before her eyes, lay the answer!</p>
<p>The little captain was the last of the onlookers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to know what had happened. She was too dazed,
perhaps, from her stay under the water.</p>
<p>It was only when Tania flung her eager, thin
arms about her beloved Fairy Godmother&#8217;s neck
that Madge actually woke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fairies who live under the water have
given you these wonderful things,&#8221; whispered
Tania. &#8220;I prayed that they would come to see
you, bringing you all the good gifts that they
had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules reached over and set the priceless
box before Madge. She was encircled by
Miss Jenny Ann and her beloved houseboat
chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all yours, Madge,&#8221; asserted Captain
Jules solemnly. &#8220;You found it, child. I should
never have discovered it but for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge shook her red-brown head. &#8220;Captain
Jules, that chest is far more yours than it is
mine. I should never have gone down under the
water but for you. If Phil had only dived first,
instead of me, she would have found it, I won&#8217;t
have any of the money or the jewelry unless I
can share it with the rest of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, to Madge&#8217;s own surprise, she began to
cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, little mate, it will be all right,&#8221;
Captain Jules assured her quietly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
had a bit too much for one day. We don&#8217;t know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
the value of what we have found just yet, but
the old jewelry will make pretty trinkets for you
girls. We&#8217;ll see about the rest later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann put her arm about Madge
on one side. Phil was on the other side of her
chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go home now, dear,&#8221; said Miss
Jenny Ann to Madge. &#8220;You are worn out from
all this excitement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll look after the girls, Captain,&#8221; promised
Tom Curtis quietly, &#8220;then I will come back to
you.&#8221; A flash of understanding passed between
Captain Jules and Tom Curtis. They had both
guessed that Madge&#8217;s iron box of old jewelry
and coins represented more money than the
girls could comprehend, and that it was better
for the news of the discovery to be kept as quiet
as possible for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will walk home with me, won&#8217;t you,
Philip?&#8221; Mrs. Curtis asked her guest. &#8220;I am
rather tired from the excitement of this most
unusual morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Philip Holt had forgotten that he wished
to keep on the good side of his wealthy hostess.
His eyes were staring eagerly and greedily at
the closed iron box which old Captain Jules was
guarding. He took a step forward, stopped and
looked at the little crowd standing near.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I can&#8217;t go back with you now, Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Curtis,&#8221; he answered abruptly, &#8220;I have some
important business to transact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis walked away deeply offended.
Philip Holt, however, was too fully occupied
with his own disappointment to note this. A
sudden daring idea had taken possession of him.
Perhaps Madge Morton was not so lucky after
all. Finding a treasure did not necessarily mean
keeping it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>MISSING, A FAIRY GODMOTHER</h3>
</div>

<p>Several days after the finding of the
treasure-chest experts came down from
Philadelphia to appraise its value. It
was not easy to decide, immediately, what market
price the old jewels, set in quaintly chased
gold, would bring. But the least that the coins
and stones would be worth was ten thousand
dollars! It might be more. An extra thousand
dollars or so was hardly worth considering,
when ten thousand would make things turn out
so beautifully even.</p>
<p>Madge and Captain Jules, Miss Jenny Ann
and the other houseboat girls had many discussions
about Madge&#8217;s discovery of the iron safe.</p>
<p>The little captain was entirely alone on one
side of the argument. The others were all
against her. Yet she won her point. She continued
to insist that her wonderful find was
purely an accident. How could she ever have
unearthed a box, lost from a sunken ship, that
had probably been buried for centuries, if Captain
Jules Fontaine had not listened to her
pleadings and taken her on the wonderful diving
trip with him? Though she had actually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
struck the first blow on the piece of iron embedded
in the bay, she could never have dragged the
safe out of the mud, or been able to carry it up
to the surface, without Captain Jules&#8217;s assistance.</p>
<p>Madge and the old sailor started their discussion
alone. The captain had come over to the
houseboat, bringing the iron safe with him so
that the girls might have a better view of its
wonders. He had firmly made up his mind that
Madge must be made to understand that the
money the treasure would bring was to be all
hers. He would not accept one cent of it. Fate
had been kinder to him than he had hoped in
allowing him to guide Madge to the discovery of
her fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten thousand dollars!&#8221; exclaimed Madge
ecstatically, when the old sailor reported the
news to her. &#8220;It&#8217;s the most wonderful thing I
ever heard of in my life. I didn&#8217;t dream it was
worth so much money. Will you please lend me
a piece of paper and a pencil, Captain Jules. I
never have been clever at arithmetic.&#8221; Madge
knitted her brows thoughtfully. &#8220;Ten thousand
dollars divided by two means five thousand dollars
for you and the same sum for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain cleared his throat. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
rest of the arithmetic?&#8221; he demanded gruffly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think much of that first division.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>But Madge was hardly listening. She was
biting the end of her pencil. &#8220;Six doesn&#8217;t go
into five thousand just evenly,&#8221; she replied
thoughtfully, &#8220;but with fractions I suppose we
can manage. You see that will be eight hundred
and thirty-three dollars and something over for
Miss Jenny Ann to put in bank to take care of
her if she ever gets sick, or has to stop teaching;
and the same sum will pay for Phil&#8217;s first year
at college and for Eleanor&#8217;s graduating at Miss
Tolliver&#8217;s, so uncle won&#8217;t have to worry over
that any more. Then my little Fairy Godmother
can go to some beautiful school in the country,
and not be shut up in a horrid home with a capital
&#8216;H,&#8217; which is what Philip Holt has persuaded
Mrs. Curtis ought to be done with her. And Lillian
can save her money to buy pretty clothes,
because she is not as poor as the rest of us and
dearly loves nice things, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Madge&#8217;s
speech ended from lack of breath.</p>
<p>The captain rubbed his rough chin reflectively.
&#8220;Oh! I see,&#8221; he nodded, &#8220;I am to get half of the
money and you are to get a sixth of a half. Is
that it?&#8221;</p>

Madge and Captain Jules Started Their Discussion Alone.<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>Madge lowered her voice to a whisper. &#8220;Dear
Captain Jules,&#8221; she said in a wheedling tone,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll help me, won&#8217;t you? The girls and Miss
Jenny Ann declare positively that they won&#8217;t accept
a single dollar of the money. I shall be the
most miserable girl in the world if they don&#8217;t.
Why, we four girls and Miss Jenny Ann have
shared everything in common, our misfortunes
and our good fortunes, since we started out together.
If any one of the other girls had happened
to discover the treasure instead of me, she
would certainly have divided it with the others.
Phil, Lillian, Eleanor and Miss Jenny Ann don&#8217;t
even dare to deny it. So they simply must give
in to me about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued the captain, &#8220;I am yet to
be told what Madge Morton means to do with the
one-sixth of one-half of her wealth when it
finally gets round to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little captain&#8217;s eyes shone, though her
face sobered. &#8220;I am not going to college with
Phil, though I hate to be parted from her,&#8221; she
replied. &#8220;Somehow, I think I am not exactly
meant for a college girl. I believe I will just advertise
in all the papers in the world for my
father. Then, if he is alive, I shall surely find
him. With whatever money is left I shall go to
him. If he is poor, I will manage to take care of
him in some way,&#8221; ended Madge confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will, eh?&#8221; returned Captain Jules
gruffly. &#8220;It seems to me, my girl, that this is a
pretty position you have mapped out for me. I
am to take half of our find&mdash;nice, selfish old
codger that I am&mdash;while you divide yours with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
your friends. I am not going to take a cent of
that money, so you can just do your sums over
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was at this point that Madge called Miss
Jenny Ann and the other houseboat girls into
the discussion. It ended with the captain&#8217;s
agreeing to take one-seventh of the money, if all
the others would follow suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, if you don&#8217;t,&#8221; declared Madge in
her usual impetuous fashion, &#8220;I shall just throw
this chest of money and jewelry right overboard
and it can go down to the bottom of the bay and
stay there, for all I care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules remained to dinner on the
houseboat that evening. After dinner the girls
proceeded to adorn themselves with the old sets
of jewelry found in the safe. Madge wore the
pearls because, she insisted, they were her
special jewels, and she had gone down to the
bottom of the bay to find them. Phil was more
fascinated with some old-fashioned garnets, Lillian
with a big, golden topaz pin, and Eleanor
with some turquoises that had turned a curious
greenish color from old age.</p>
<p>It was well after ten o&#8217;clock when the captain
announced that he must set out for home. Tom
Curtis had been spending the evening on the
houseboat with the girls, but he had gone home
an hour before to join his mother and her guest,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Philip Holt. Before going away the captain
concluded that it would be best for him to leave
the iron safe of coins and precious stones on the
houseboat for the night. It was too late for
him to carry it back to &#8220;The Anchorage&#8221; alone.
As no one but Tom knew of its being on the
houseboat, the valuables could be in no possible
danger. The captain would call some time within
the next day or so to take the iron box to a
safety deposit vault in the town of Cape May.</p>
<p>Together Miss Jenny Ann and the captain hid
the precious chest in a small drawer in the sideboard
built into the wall of the little dining room
cabin of the houseboat. They locked this drawer
carefully and Miss Jenny Ann hid the key under
her pillow without speaking of it to any one.</p>
<p>In spite of these precautions no one on the
houseboat dreamed of any possible danger to
the safety of their newly-found prize. Remember,
no one knew of its being on the houseboat
save Tom Curtis and Captain Jules. Up to to-night
Captain Jules had been guarding the
treasure at his house up the bay. No one had
been allowed to see it since the famous day of
its discovery, except the experts who had come
down from Philadelphia to give some idea of the
value of Madge&#8217;s remarkable find.</p>
<p>Little Tania was in the habit of sleeping in
the dining room of the houseboat on a cot which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
Miss Jenny Ann prepared for her each night.
She went to bed earlier than the other girls, so
in order not to disturb her, she was stowed away
in there instead of occupying one of the berths
in the two staterooms. Soon after the captain&#8217;s
departure Miss Jenny Ann tucked Tania safely
in bed. She closed the door of the dining room
that led out on the cabin deck and also the door
that connected with the stateroom occupied by
Madge and Phil. The cabin of the &#8220;Merry
Maid&#8221; was a square divided into four rooms,
and Miss Jenny Ann&#8217;s bedroom did not open
directly into the dining room.</p>
<p>It was a dark night and a strangely still one.
The weather was unusually warm and close for
Cape May. Over the flat marshes and islands
the heat was oppressive. The residents of the
summer cottages left their doors and windows
open, hoping that a stray breeze might spring
up during the night to refresh them. No one
seemed to have any fear of burglars.</p>
<p>On the &#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; the night was so still
and cloudy that the girls sat up for an hour
after Captain Jules left them, talking over their
wonderful good fortune. They were almost
asleep before they tumbled into their berths.
Once there, they slept soundly all night long.
Nothing apparently happened to disturb them,
but Madge, who was the lightest sleeper in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
party, did half-waken at one time during the
night. She thought she heard Tania cry out.
It was a peculiar cry and was not repeated. She
knew that Tania was given to dreaming. Almost
every night the child made some kind of
sound in her sleep. Madge sat up in bed and
listened, but hearing no further sound, she went
fast asleep again without a thought of anxiety.</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann was the first to open her
eyes the next morning. It must have been as
late as seven o&#8217;clock, for the sun was shining
brilliantly. She slipped on her wrapper and
went into the kitchen to start the fire. A few
moments later she went into the dining room to
call Tania and to help the child to dress. But
the dining room door on to the cabin deck was
open. Tania&#8217;s bedclothes were in a heap on the
floor. The child had disappeared.</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann was not in the least uneasy
or annoyed. She knew that Tania had a way of
creeping in Madge&#8217;s bed in the early mornings
and of snuggling close to her. Miss Jenny
Ann tip-toed softly into Madge&#8217;s and Phil&#8217;s
stateroom. There was no dark head with its
straight, short black hair and quaint, elfish face
pressed close against Madge&#8217;s lovely auburn
one. Madge was slumbering peacefully. Miss
Jenny Ann peered into the upper berth. Phil
was alone and had not stirred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>Tania was such a queer, wild little thing! Miss
Jenny Ann felt annoyed. Perhaps Tania had
awakened and slipped off the boat without telling
any of them. She had solemnly promised
never to run away again, but she might have
broken her word. Miss Jenny Ann explored the
houseboat decks. She called the child&#8217;s name
softly once or twice so as not to disturb the other
girls. There was no answer. She went back
into the cabin dining room. Neatly folded on the
chair, where Miss Jenny Ann herself had placed
them the night before, were Tania&#8217;s clothes. The
child could hardly have run away in her little
white nightgown.</p>
<p>When the girls finally wakened Madge was the
only one of them who was alarmed at first. She
recalled Tania&#8217;s strange cry in the night. She
wondered if it could have been possible that she
had heard a sound before the little girl cried
out. But she could not decide. She would not
believe, however, that Tania had forgotten her
promise and gone away again without permission.</p>
<p>As soon as Eleanor and Lillian were dressed
they went ashore and walked up and down near
the houseboat, calling aloud for Tania. Phyllis
was the most composed of the party. She had
two small twin sisters of her own and knew that
children were in the habit of creating just such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
unnecessary excitements. Still, it was better to
look for a lost child before she had had time to
wander too far away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge,&#8221; suggested Phil quietly, &#8220;don&#8217;t be
so frightened about Tania. I have an idea the
child has walked off the houseboat in her sleep.
She must have done so, for the dining room door
is unlocked from the inside. Our door on to the
deck was not locked, but Tania&#8217;s was, because
Miss Jenny Ann recalls having locked it herself.
She came through our room when she joined us
outdoors after putting Tania to bed. You and
I had better go up at once to find Tom Curtis.
Dear old Tom is such a comfort! He will help
us search for Tania. Then, if it is necessary, he
will ask the Cape May authorities to have the police
on the lookout for her. If Tania has wandered
off in her sleep, the poor little thing will be
terrified when she wakes up and finds herself in
a strange place. Surely, some one will take her
in and care for her until we find her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge and Phil were wonderfully glad to find
Tom Curtis up and alone on his front veranda.
He had just come in from a swim. He seemed
so strong, clean, and fine after his morning&#8217;s
dip in the ocean that his two girl friends were
immediately reassured. Tom would tell them
just what had better be done to find Tania.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s and Philip Holt&#8217;s window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
blinds are still down, thank goodness!&#8221; whispered
Madge to Phil, &#8220;so I suppose they are
both asleep. Let us not tell them anything
about Tania&#8217;s disappearance. They would just
put it down to naughtiness in her, and that
would make me awfully cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Curtis felt perfectly sure that he would
soon run across the lost Tania. So he left word
for his mother that he had gone to the houseboat
and that she was not to expect him until
she saw him again.</p>
<p>For two hours Tom and the houseboat party
continued the hunt for the lost child without
calling in assistance. Then Madge and Tom
went to the town authorities of Cape May. The
police investigated the city and the houses in the
nearby seaside resort without finding the least
clue to Tania. Toward the close of the long day
Tom Curtis began to fear that Tania had fallen
into the water. Cape May is only a strip of
land between the great ocean and the bay, and
the land is broken into many small islands nearly
surrounded by salt water and marshes.</p>
<p>Tom managed to get the girls safely out of
the way; then, with Miss Jenny Ann&#8217;s permission,
he had the water near the houseboat thoroughly
dredged. But Tania&#8217;s little body was
not found for the second time down in the bottom
of the bay. It was not possible to have all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
the water in the neighborhood dragged in a
single day, so Tom said nothing of his fears to
his anxious friends.</p>
<p>It was late in the evening. Miss Jenny Ann
had prepared dinner for the weary and disheartened
girls. She had snowy biscuit, broiled ham,
roasted potatoes, milk, and honey, the very
things her charges usually loved. Tom Curtis
felt impelled to go back home. All that day he
had seen nothing of his mother or of their visitor,
Philip Holt, and Tom was afraid they would
begin to wonder what had become of him.</p>
<p>Madge caught Tom by the sleeve and looked
at him with beseeching eyes. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t go,
Tom,&#8221; she begged, with a catch in her voice,
&#8220;I am sure your mother won&#8217;t mind. She has
Mr. Holt with her, and I can&#8217;t bear to see you
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom and Madge were near the gangplank of
the houseboat and Tom was trying to make up
his mind what he should do, when he and Madge
caught sight of a gray-clad figure walking toward
them through the twilight mists.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mother,&#8221; explained Tom in a relieved
tone. &#8220;Now I can make it all right with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that horrid Philip Holt isn&#8217;t along,&#8221;
declared Madge delightedly, &#8220;so I can tell her
about poor little Tania.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis caught Madge, who had run out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
to meet her, by the hand. &#8220;My dear child, what
is the matter with you?&#8221; the older woman asked
immediately. &#8220;Even in this half-light I can see
that your face is pale as death and you look utterly
worn out. If one of you is ill, why have
you not sent for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Madge faltered out her story of the lost
Tania Mrs. Curtis hugged her to her in the old
sympathetic way that the little captain knew and
loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry, dear,&#8221; soothed Mrs. Curtis,
&#8220;but I am sure than Tom and Philip Holt will
find her. I suppose that is why they have both
been away all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Philip Holt!&#8221; exclaimed Tom in surprise.
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t been with us. I thought he was at
home with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis shook her head indifferently.
&#8220;No; he hasn&#8217;t been at the cottage all day.
Have any of you thought to send word to Captain
Jules to ask him about Tania? It may be
that the child is with him. In any event, I know
Captain Jules would give us good advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully for you, Mother!&#8221; cried Tom, glad to
catch a straw as he saw the shadow on Madge&#8217;s
face lighten. &#8220;As soon as I have had a bite of
supper with the girls I&#8217;ll get hold of a boat and
go after the captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom did not have to make his journey up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
bay to &#8220;The Anchorage&#8221; that night. While he
and his mother were at supper with the girls
they heard the sound of Captain Jules&#8217;s voice
calling to them over the water. He had to come
ashore lower down the bay, where the water was
deeper than it was near the houseboat, but he
always hallooed as he approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Jenny Ann!&#8221; faltered Madge, trembling
like a leaf, &#8220;it is our captain. Perhaps he has
brought Tania back with him. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope nothing
dreadful has happened to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word Tom fled off the houseboat.
A moment later he espied Captain Jules coming
toward him, alone!</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloo, son!&#8221; called out Captain Jules
cheerfully. &#8220;Glad to know that you are down
here with the girls. Funny thing, but I&#8217;ve had
these girls on my mind all day. It seemed to
me that they needed me, and I couldn&#8217;t go to
bed without finding out that everything was
well with them. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; Captain
Jules had caught a fleeting glimpse of Tom&#8217;s
harassed face. &#8220;Is it&mdash;is it Madge?&#8221; he asked
anxiously. &#8220;Is anything the matter with my
girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom shook his head reassuringly. It took
very few words to make the captain understand
that the trouble was over Tania and not Madge.</p>
<p>When, a moment later, the captain went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
aboard the &#8220;Merry Maid&#8221; he was able to smile
bravely at the discouraged women.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, here!&#8221; he cried gruffly, while Madge
clung to one of his horny hands for support and
Eleanor to the other, &#8220;what is all this nonsense
I hear? Tania is not really lost, of course.
I&#8217;ll bet you we find the little witch in no time.
She has just gone off somewhere in these New
Jersey woods to join the fairies she talks so
much about. They are sure to take good care
of her. We can&#8217;t do much more looking for her
to-night, but I&#8217;ll find her first thing in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Captain Jules and Mrs. Curtis insisted
that the girls and Miss Jenny Ann go early to
bed. Just as Captain Jules was saying good
night it occurred to Miss Jenny Ann that she
would rather turn over to the old sailor the box
of coins and jewelry. While Tania was lost
there would be so many persons in and out of
the houseboat that Miss Jenny Ann feared
something might happen to the valuables.</p>
<p>She went to the drawer in the sideboard in the
saloon cabin without thinking of the key under
her pillow, and took hold of the knob. To her
surprise the drawer opened readily. There was
no iron safe inside it. Miss Jenny Ann ran to
her bed and felt under her pillow. The key was
still there as though it had never been disturbed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>Captain Jules and Tom decided that the simple
lock to the houseboat sideboard had been
easily broken open. When, or how, or by whom,
nobody knew, but it was certain that the jewels
and money were gone. Fortune, the fickle jade,
who had brought the houseboat girls such good
luck only a short time before, had now cruelly
stolen it away from them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE WICKED GENII</h3>
</div>

<p>Tania had been aroused in the night by
seeing a dark figure standing with his
back to her only a few feet from her bed.
Involuntarily the child stirred. In that instant
a black-masked face turned toward her and
Tania gave the single, terrified scream that
Madge had heard. Before Tania could call out
again, a handkerchief was tied so closely around
her mouth that she could make no further sound.</p>
<p>A moment later the mysterious, sinister visitor
picked the child up in his arms and bore her
swiftly and quietly away from the shelter of the
houseboat and her beloved friends. The little
girl was very slender, yet her abductor staggered
as he walked. He had something besides
Tania that he was carrying.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile from the houseboat
Tania was dumped into the rear end of an
automobile and covered with a heavy steamer
blanket. Then the automobile started off
through the night, going faster and faster, it
seemed to her, with each hour of darkness that
remained.</p>
<p>At times the little prisoner slept. When she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
awakened she cried softly to herself, wondering
who had stolen away with her and what was now
to become of her. But Tania was only a child of
the streets and she had been reared in a harder
school than other happier children, so she made
no effort to cry out or escape. She knew there
was no one near to hear her, and the motor car
was moving so swiftly that she could not possibly
escape from it.</p>
<p>Tania and her unknown companion must have
ridden all night. Evidently the driver of the
car had not cared about the roads. He had
pushed through heavy sand and ploughed over
deep holes regardless of his machine. Speed
was the only thing he thought of.</p>
<p>By and by the automobile stopped, after a
particularly bad piece of traveling. The driver
got down, lifted Tania, still wrapped in her
blanket, in his arms and carried her inside a
house. The child first saw the light in an old
room, up several flights of steps, which was
drearier and more miserable than anything she
had ever beheld in her life in the tenements. It
was big and mouldy, and dark with cobwebs
swinging like dusty curtains over the windows
that had not been washed for years. The windows
looked out over a swamp that was thick
with old trees.</p>
<p>But Tania saw none of these things when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
blanket was first lifted from her head. She
gave a gasp of fright and horror. For the first
time she now realized that her captor was her
childhood&#8217;s enemy and evil genius, Philip Holt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she exclaimed, with a long-drawn sigh
that was almost a sob, &#8220;it is <i>you</i>! Why have
you brought me here? What have I done?&#8221;
Then a look of unearthly wisdom came into Tania&#8217;s
solemn, black eyes. She continued to
stare at the young man so silently and gravely
that Philip Holt&#8217;s blonde face twitched with
nervousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you recognize me before?&#8221; he asked
fiercely. &#8220;You were quite likely to shriek out in
the night and spoil everything, so I had to carry
you off with me, little nuisance that you are!
You can just make up your mind, young woman,
that you will stay right here in this room until
I can take you to that nice institution for bad
children that I have been telling you about for
such a long time. You&#8217;ll never see your houseboat
friends again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tania made no answer, and Philip Holt left
her sitting on the floor of the gloomy room wide-eyed
and silent.</p>
<p>For three days Tania stayed alone in that
cheerless room. She saw no one but an old, half-foolish
man who came to her three times a
day to bring her food. He gave Tania a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
rough garments to dress herself in and treated
the little prisoner kindly, but Tania found it
was quite useless to ask the old man questions.
She was a wise, silent child, with considerable
knowledge of life, and she understood
that there was nothing to be gained by talking
to her jailer, who would now and then grin foolishly
and tell her that she was to be good and
everything would soon be all right. Her nice,
kind brother was going to take her away to
school as soon as he could. The wicked people
who had been trying to steal her away from her
own brother should never find her if her brother
could help it.</p>
<p>So the long nights passed and the longer days,
and little Tania would have been very miserable
indeed except for her fairies and her dreams.
It is never possible to be unhappy all the time, if
you own a dream world of your own. Still, Tania
found it much harder to pretend things, now
that she had tasted real happiness with her
houseboat girls, than she had when she lived
with old Sal. It wasn&#8217;t much fun to play at being
an enchanted princess when you knew what
it was to feel like a really happy little girl. And
no one would care to be taken away to the most
wonderful castle in fairyland if she had to leave
the darling houseboat and Madge and Miss
Jenny Ann and the other girls behind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></p>
<p>So all through the daylight Tania sat with her
small, pale face pressed against the dirty window
pane, waiting for Madge to come and find
her. She even hoped that a stranger might walk
along close enough to the house for her to call
for aid. But a dreary rain set in and all the
countryside near Tania&#8217;s prison house looked
desolate. More than anything Tania feared the
return of Philip Holt. Once he got hold of her
again, she knew he would fulfill his threats.</p>
<p>During this dreadful time Tania had no human
companion, but she was not like other children.
She was part little girl and the rest of
her an elf or a fay. The trees, the birds, and
flowers were almost as real to her as human beings.
For, until Madge and Eleanor had found
her dancing on the New York City street corner,
she had never had anybody to be kind to her, or
whom she could love.</p>
<p>Just outside Tania&#8217;s window there was a tall
old cedar tree. Its long arms reached quite up
to her window sill, and when the wind blew it
used to wave her its greetings. Inside the comfortable
branches of the tree there was a regular
apartment house of birds, the nests rising one
above the other to the topmost limbs.</p>
<p>Tania held long conversations with these birds
in the mornings and in the late afternoons. She
told them all her troubles, and how very much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
she would like to get away from the place where
she was now staying. However, the birds were
great gad-abouts during the day, and Tania
could hardly blame them.</p>
<p>There was one fat, fatherly robin that became
Tania&#8217;s particular friend. He used to hop
about near her window and nod and chirp to her
as though to reassure her. &#8220;Your friends will
come for you to-day, I am quite sure of it,&#8221; he
used to say, until one day Tania really spoke
aloud to him and was startled at the sound of
her own voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you are a robin at all,&#8221; she
announced. &#8220;I just believe you are a nice, fat
father of a whole lot of funny little boys and
girls. I believe you are enchanted, like me. Oh,
dear! I was just beginning to believe that I
wasn&#8217;t a fairy after all but a real little girl with
pretty clothes and friends to kiss me good
night.&#8221; Tania sighed. &#8220;I suppose I must be
a fairy princess after all, for if I was a real
little girl no one would have cast another wicked
spell over me and shut me up in this dungeon in
the woods, which is a whole lot worse than living
with old Sal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet playing and pretending, and, worse than
anything, waiting, grew very tiresome to Tania.
On the morning of the fourth day of her imprisonment
Tania awoke with a start. Something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
had knocked on her window pane. It was
only the old cedar tree, and Tania turned over
in bed with a sob. But the tapping went on.
She got up and went to her window. Quick as a
flash Tania made up her mind to run away. Why
had she never thought of it before? It was true,
her bedroom door was always locked, but here
were the branches of the cedar tree reaching
close up to her window. Really, this morning
they seemed to speak quite distinctly to Tania:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in the world don&#8217;t you come to me? I
shall hold you quite safe! You can climb down
through all my arms to the warm earth and then
run away to your friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was just after dawn. The pink sky was
showing against the earlier grayness when Tania
slipped into her coarse clothes and, like a
small elf, crept out of her window into the
friendly branches of the old tree. She was silent
and swift as a squirrel as she clambered
down. But she need not have feared. No one in
the lonely country place was awake but the
child.</p>
<p>Once on the ground, Tania ran on and on,
without thinking where she was going. She only
wished to get far away from the dreary house
where Philip Holt had hidden her. There was a
thick woods about a mile or so from Tania&#8217;s
starting place. No one would find her there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
Once she was through it Tania hoped to find
a town, or at least a farm, where she could ask
for help. In spite of her queer, unchildlike ways,
Tania knew enough to understand that if she
could only find some one to telegraph to her
friends they would soon come to her.</p>
<p>But the forest through which Tania hoped to
pass was a dreadful cedar swamp, and in trying
to cross it Tania wandered far into it and found
herself hopelessly lost.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A BOW OF SCARLET RIBBON</h3>
</div>

<p>In the three days that had passed since the
disappearance of Tania from the houseboat
everything that was possible had been
done to discover her whereabouts.</p>
<p>It never occurred to Tom or to Mrs. Curtis
to connect Philip Holt&#8217;s odd behavior with the
lost Tania or the vanished treasure box. True,
he had not been seen for the past three days, but
Mrs. Curtis had received a note from him the
day after his disappearance from her house,
saying that he had been unexpectedly called
away on very important business so early in
the morning that he had not wished to awaken
her, but he had left word with the servants and
he hoped that they had explained matters to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s maids and butler insisted that
Mr. Holt had given them no message. They had
not seen or heard him go. So, as Mrs. Curtis
did not regard Philip Holt&#8217;s withdrawal as of
any importance, she gave very little thought to
it.</p>
<p>Madge Morton, however, had a different idea.
She laid Tania&#8217;s disappearance at Philip Holt&#8217;s
door. She, therefore, determined to take Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
Curtis into her confidence, but to ask him not to
betray their suspicions of Philip Holt to Mrs.
Curtis until they had better proof of the young
man&#8217;s guilt. Madge had never told even Tom
that she had once overheard Philip Holt reveal
his real identity, nor how much she had guessed
of the young man&#8217;s true character from Tania&#8217;s
unconscious and frightened reports of him.</p>
<p>Tom at first was indignant with Madge, not
because she and the other girls believed that
Philip Holt had stolen both their little friend
and their new-found wealth, but because she had
not sooner shared her suspicion of his mother&#8217;s
guest with him. Tom had never liked Philip, so
it was easy for him to think the worst of the
goody-goody young man.</p>
<p>Without a word to Mrs. Curtis, Tom and the
houseboat girls set to work to trace Philip Holt,
believing that once he was overtaken Tania and
the stolen treasure would be accounted for.</p>
<p>It was not easy work. Philip Holt had not
been a hypocrite all his life without knowing
how to play the game of deception. A detective
sent to New York City to talk to old Sal had
nothing worth while to report. The woman declared
positively that Philip was no connection
of hers; that she had neither seen nor heard of
the young man lately. As for Tania, Sal had
truly not set eyes on her from the day that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
Madge had taken the little one under her protection.</p>
<p>Philip Holt knew well enough that his mother
would be questioned about his disappearance.
He believed that Tania had told Madge his true
history. So old Sal was prepared with her
story when the detective interviewed her. Yet
it was curious that the Cape May police were
unable to find out in what manner the young man
had left the town. Inquiries at the railroad stations,
livery stables, and garages gave no clue
to him.</p>
<p>The houseboat girls were in despair. Madge
neither ate nor slept. She felt particularly responsible
for Tania, as the child had been her
special charge and protégé. Madge had been
deeply grieved when her friend, David Brewster,
had been falsely accused of a crime in their
previous houseboat holiday, when they had
spent a part of their time with Mr. and Mrs.
Preston in Virginia; but that sorrow was as
nothing to this, for David was almost a grown
boy and able to look after himself, while Tania
was little more than a baby. When no news
came of either Philip Holt or Tania, Madge began
to believe that Philip Holt had accomplished
his design. He had managed to shut Tania up
in some kind of dreadful institution. The little
captain did not believe that they would ever find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
the child, and was so unhappy over the loss of
her Fairy Godmother that she lost her usual
power to act.</p>
<p>Phyllis Alden, however, was wide awake and
on the alert. She knew that it was not possible
for Philip Holt to leave Cape May without some
one&#8217;s assistance. Some one must know how and
when he had disappeared. The whole point was
to find that person.</p>
<p>Phil thought over the matter for some time.
Then she quietly telephoned to Ethel Swann
and asked her to arrange something for her.
She made an appointment to call on Ethel the
same afternoon, and she and Lillian walked over
to the Swann cottage together. It seemed
strange to Madge that her two friends could
have the heart for making calls, but, as there was
absolutely nothing for them to do save to wait
for news of Tania that did not come, she said
nothing save that she did not feel well enough
to accompany them.</p>
<p>As Lillian and Phyllis Alden approached the
Swann summer cottage they saw that Ethel had
with her on the veranda the two young people
who had been most unfriendly to them during
their stay at Cape May, Roy Dennis and Mabel
Farrar.</p>
<p>Roy Dennis got up hurriedly. His face flushed
a dull red, and he began backing down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
veranda steps, explaining to Ethel that he must
be off at once.</p>
<p>Phyllis Alden was always direct. Before Roy
Dennis could get away from her she walked directly
up to him, and looking him squarely in
the eyes said quietly: &#8220;Mr. Dennis, please don&#8217;t
go away before I have a chance to speak to you.
It seems absurd to me for us to be such enemies,
simply because something happened between
us in the beginning of the summer that
wasn&#8217;t very agreeable. I wished to ask you a
question, so I asked Ethel to arrange this meeting
between us this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you wish to ask me?&#8221; he returned
awkwardly.</p>
<p>Phil plunged directly into her subject.
&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you and Philip Holt great friends
while he was Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s guest?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Roy Dennis looked uncomfortable. &#8220;We were
fairly good friends, but not pals,&#8221; he assured
Phil.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you, perhaps, know him well enough to
have him tell you where he was going when he
left Mrs. Curtis&#8217;s,&#8221; continued Phil in a calmly
assured tone. &#8220;Mrs. Curtis has not received a
letter from him since he left here, so she does
not know just where he is. We girls on the
houseboat would also like very much to know
what has become of Mr. Holt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded Roy Dennis sharply.</p>
<p>Phyllis determined to be perfectly frank. &#8220;I
will tell you my reason for asking you that
question,&#8221; she began. &#8220;You may not know it,
but our little friend, Tania, disappeared from
Cape May the very same day that Philip Holt
left the Cape. We all knew that Mr. Holt had
known Tania for a number of years before we
met her. He thought that the child ought to be
shut up in some kind of an institution, but Miss
Morton wished to put the little girl in a school.
So it may just be barely possible that Mr. Holt
took Tania away without asking leave of any
one.&#8221; Phil made absolutely no reference to the
stolen money and jewels in her talk with Roy
Dennis. If they could run down Philip Holt
and Tania the treasure-box would be disclosed
as a matter of course.</p>
<p>Roy Dennis hesitated for barely a second.
Then he remarked to Phil, half-admiringly:
&#8220;You have been frank with me, Miss Alden, and,
to tell you the truth, I think it is about time that
I be equally frank with you. I have no idea
where Philip Holt now is, but I do know something
about how he got away from Cape May,
and I am beginning to have my suspicions that
there might have been something &#8216;shady&#8217; in his
behavior that I did not think of at the time.
Three nights ago, it must have been about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
eleven o&#8217;clock, I was just about ready for bed
when Mr. Holt rang me up and asked to speak
to me alone. He said that he had just had bad
news and wished to get out of Cape May as
soon as possible. He asked me if I would lend
him my car so that he could drive to a nearby
railroad station where he could get a train that
would take him sooner to the place he wished
to go. I thought it was rather a strange request
and asked him why he didn&#8217;t borrow Tom
Curtis&#8217;s car? He said that Mrs. Curtis had
gone to bed and that he did not like to disturb
her. He and Tom had never been friendly, so
he did not wish to ask him a favor. Well, I
can&#8217;t say I felt very cheerful at letting Philip
Holt have the use of my car, but he said that he
would send it back in a few hours and it would
be all right. I got it out for him myself and he
drove away in it. It didn&#8217;t come back until this
morning, and you never saw such a sight in your
life, covered with mud and the tires almost used
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Phil nodded sympathetically. &#8220;Who brought
the car back to you?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Was it Mr.
Holt?&#8221;</p>
<p>Roy Dennis shrugged his heavy shoulders.
&#8220;No, indeed! He sent it back by a chap who
wouldn&#8217;t say a word about himself, Holt, or
from which direction he had come.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is the man still in town?&#8221; asked Phil, her
voice trembling, &#8220;and would you mind Tom
Curtis&#8217;s asking him some questions? We are
so awfully anxious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roy Dennis rose quickly. &#8220;I believe the fellow
is around yet, and I&#8217;ll get hold of him and
take him to Tom at once. I don&#8217;t think that
Philip Holt has had anything to do with the kidnapping
of the little girl, but his whole behavior
looks pretty funny. We will make the chauffeur
chap tell us where Philip Holt was when he
turned over my car to him.&#8221; Roy was off like a
flash.</p>
<p>Phyllis and Lillian were making their apologies
to Ethel for being obliged to hurry off at
once to the houseboat when Mabel Farrar took
hold of Phil&#8217;s hand. Her usually haughty expression
had changed to one of the deepest interest.
&#8220;I am <i>so</i> sorry about the little lost girl,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I hope you will soon find her. She
is a queer, fascinating little thing. I have
watched her all summer, and she certainly can
dance. I can&#8217;t believe that Philip Holt has actually
stolen her, yet I don&#8217;t know. Roy Dennis
just told Ethel Swann and me something awfully
queer. He says he found a bright scarlet
ribbon, like a bow that a child would wear in her
hair, in the bottom of his motor car when the
chauffeur brought it back to him to-day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s black eyes flashed. &#8220;If I ever needed
anything to convince me that Philip Holt stole
Tania away from us that would do it,&#8221; she returned
indignantly. &#8220;Little Tania slept every
night with her hair tied up with a scarlet ribbon
so as to keep it out of her eyes. When we
find where Philip Holt is we shall find Tania,
and if I have any say in the matter he shall answer
to the law for what he has done.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE RACE FOR LIFE</h3>
</div>

<p>It took the united efforts of the Cape May
police, Tom Curtis, and Roy Dennis to
make the chauffeur who had come back
with Roy&#8217;s car say where he had met Philip
Holt, and when Philip had turned over the automobile
to him to be brought back to Roy.</p>
<p>The chauffeur was frightened; he finally
broke down and told the whole story. Philip
Holt had driven from the farmhouse where he
left Tania to the nearest village. There he had
hired the chauffeur and the man had taken
Philip within a few miles of New York. In
the course of the ride, Philip had told the automobile
driver the same story about Tania that
he had told the old man in the tumbled-down
farmhouse:</p>
<p>Tania was Philip&#8217;s sister. He was hiding her
from enemies, who wished to steal the child
away from him. If anybody inquired about the
child or about him the chauffeur was to say
nothing. Philip would pay him handsomely for
bringing the car back to Cape May.</p>
<p>The reason that Philip Holt had sent back
Roy Dennis&#8217;s automobile was because he knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
that Roy would put detectives on his track if
he failed to return it. Besides, it would be far
easier for Philip Holt to get away with his precious
iron safe if he were free of all other entanglements.</p>
<p>It was nearly midnight before the story that
the chauffeur told was clear to Tom Curtis. The
man believed that he knew the very house in
which Tania was probably concealed. There
was no other place like it near the town where
the chauffeur lived.</p>
<p>Tom got out his own automobile. The chauffeur
would ride with him. They would go directly
to the old farmhouse. Tania would be
there and all would soon be well.</p>
<p>It was about nine o&#8217;clock the next morning
when Tom&#8217;s thundering knock at the rickety
farmhouse door brought the foolish old man
to open it. As soon as Tom mentioned Tania,
the old fellow was alarmed. He was stupid and
poor, but Philip Holt&#8217;s behavior had begun to
look strange even to him.</p>
<p>The old farmer was glad to tell Tom Curtis
everything he knew. It was all right. Tania
was safe upstairs. He would take Tom up at
once to see her. He was just on his way up to
take Tania her breakfast. Indeed, the old man
explained with tears in his eyes, he had not
meant to assist in the kidnapping of a child. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
was only a poor, lonely old fellow and he hadn&#8217;t
meant any harm. He had never seen Philip
until the moment that the young man appeared
at his door in his automobile and asked him to
look after his sister for a few days.</p>
<p>The farmer&#8217;s story was true. Philip Holt
had no idea how he could safely dispose of
Tania. Quite by accident, as he hurried through
the country, he had espied the old house. If
Tania could be kept hidden there for a few days
he would then be able to decide what he could do
with her.</p>
<p>Tom would have liked to bound up the old
stairs three steps at a time to Tania&#8217;s bedroom
door. Poor little girl, what she must have suffered
in the last three days! But Tom&#8217;s thought
was always for Madge. Before he followed the
farmer to Tania&#8217;s chamber he wrote a telegram
which he made the chauffeur take over to the
village to send immediately. It read: &#8220;All is
well with Tania. Come at once.&#8221; And it was
addressed to Madge Morton.</p>
<p>Tom was trembling like a girl with sympathy
and compassion when he finally reached little
Tania&#8217;s bedroom door. He wished Madge or
his mother were with him. How could he comfort
poor Tania for all she had suffered?</p>
<p>Tania&#8217;s jailer unlocked the door and knocked
at it softly. The child did not answer. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
knocked at it again and tried to make his voice
friendly. &#8220;Come to the door, little one,&#8221; he entreated.
&#8220;I know you will be glad to see who it
is that has come to take you back to your home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still no answer. Tom could endure the waiting
no longer, but flung the door wide open. No
Tania was to be seen. There was no place to
look for her in the empty room, which held only
a bed and a single chair. But a window was
open and the arm of the old cedar tree still
pressed close against the sill. Tom could see
that small twigs had been broken off of some of
the branches. He guessed at once what had
happened. Tania had climbed down this tree
and run away. But Tom felt perfectly sure that
he would be able to find her before the houseboat
party and his mother could arrive.</p>
<p>The houseboat girls and Miss Jenny Ann
were overjoyed at Tom&#8217;s telegram. Mrs. Curtis
was with them when the message came. She
was perhaps the happiest of them all, although
she had never been an especial friend of little
Tania&#8217;s. In the last few days her conscience
had pricked her a little and her warm heart had
sorrowed over the missing child.</p>
<p>Yet, up to this very moment, Mrs. Curtis did
not know the truth about Philip Holt. Just before
they started for the train that was to bear
them to Tom and Tania Madge told Mrs. Curtis
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
that Philip had stolen the child from them and
that they also believed he had run off with their
treasure-chest.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis listened very quietly to Madge&#8217;s
story. When the little captain had finished
she asked humbly, &#8220;Can you ever forgive me,
dear? I am an obstinate and spoiled woman.
If only I had listened to what you told me about
Philip this sorrow would never have come to
you. Tom also warned me that I was being deceived
in Philip Holt. But I believed you were
both prejudiced against him. When we recover
Tania I shall try to make up to her the wrong I
have done her, if it is ever possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the journey Madge and Mrs. Curtis
sat hand in hand. Captain Jules looked after
Miss Jenny Ann, Lillian, Phil and Eleanor, although
he was almost as excited by Tom&#8217;s news
as they were.</p>
<p>At the country station the chauffeur was waiting
to drive Tania&#8217;s friends to the lonely old
farmhouse that the child had thought a dungeon.</p>
<p>Tom and Tania would probably be standing in
the front yard when the automobile arrived.
They were not there. The old farmer explained
that Tom and Tania had gone out together. They
would be back in a few minutes. To tell the
truth, the man did expect them to appear at any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
time. He could not believe that Tania was really
lost, although Tom had been searching for
her since early morning and it was now about
four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>For two hours the houseboat party waited.
The girls walked up and down the rickety farmhouse
porch, clinging to Captain Jules. Mrs.
Curtis and Miss Jenny Ann remained indoors.
At dusk Tom returned. He was alone and
could hardly drag one foot after the other, he
was so weary and heartsick. To think that after
wiring her he had found Tania he must face
Madge with the dreadful news that the child
was lost again!</p>
<p>Two long, weary days passed without news of
the lost Tania. The houseboat party made the
old farmhouse their headquarters while conducting
the search. At first no one thought to
penetrate the cedar swamp where Tania had
hidden herself, but the idea finally occurred to
Tom Curtis, and on the third morning he and
Captain Jules started out.</p>
<p>All that third anxious day the girls searched
the immediate neighborhood for Tania. When
evening came they gathered sadly in the wretched
farmhouse, to await the return of Tom Curtis
and the old sea captain.</p>
<p>Madge was lying on a rickety lounge, with her
face buried in her hands. Phyllis was sitting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
near the door. Mrs. Curtis stood at the window,
watching for the return of her son. In a
further corner of the room, Miss Jenny Ann,
Lillian and Eleanor were talking softly together.</p>
<p>Suddenly each one of the sad women became
aware of the captain&#8217;s presence as his big form
darkened the doorway. A ray of light from
their single oil lamp shone across his weather-beaten
face. Phil saw him most distinctly and
read disaster in his glance. With the unselfish
thought of others that invariably marks a great
nature, she went swiftly across the room and
dropped on her knees beside Madge.</p>
<p>Madge sprang from her lounge and stumbled
across the room toward the old sailor. Phil kept
close beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tania!&#8221; whispered Madge faintly, for she
too had seen the captain&#8217;s face. &#8220;Where is my
little Fairy Godmother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found Tania, Madge,&#8221; said Captain
Jules gently, &#8220;but she is very ill. We
found her lying under a tree in the swamp, delirious
with fever. She is almost starved, and
she is so frail&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The old man&#8217;s voice
broke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say she is going to die, Captain
Jules,&#8221; implored Mrs. Curtis. &#8220;If she does, I
shall feel that I am responsible. Surely, something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
can be done for her.&#8221; The proud woman
buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>At that moment Tom entered, bearing in his
arms a frail little figure, whose thin hands
moved incessantly and whose black eyes were
bright with fever.</p>
<p>With a cry of &#8220;Tania, dear little Fairy Godmother,
you mustn&#8217;t, you shan&#8217;t die!&#8221; Madge
sprang to Tom&#8217;s side and caught the little, restless
hands in hers.</p>
<p>For an instant the black eyes looked recognition.
&#8220;Madge,&#8221; Tania said clearly, &#8220;he took
me away&mdash;the Wicked Genii.&#8221; Her voice trailed
off into indistinct muttering.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be rushed to a hospital at once.&#8221;
Captain Jules&#8217;s calm voice roused the sorrowing
friends of little Tania to action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have my car at the door in ten minutes,&#8221;
declared Tom huskily. &#8220;Make her as comfortable
as you can for the journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in Captain Jules&#8217;s strong arms that
little Tania made the journey to a private sanatorium
at Cape May. Madge sat beside the
captain, her eyes fixed upon the little, dark head
that lay against the captain&#8217;s broad shoulder.
The strong, magnetic touch of the old sailor
seemed to quiet the fever-stricken child, and, for
the first time since they had found her, Tania
lay absolutely still in his arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis occupied the front seat with her
son, who drove his car at a rate of speed that
would have caused a traffic officer to hold up his
hands in horror. It had been arranged that
Tom should return to the farmhouse as soon as
possible for the rest of the party.</p>
<p>No one of the occupants of the car ever forgot
that ride. Once at the hospital, no time was lost
in caring for Tania. The physician in attendance,
however, would give them no satisfaction
as to Tania&#8217;s condition beyond the admission
that it was very serious. Mrs. Curtis engaged
the most expensive room in the hospital for the
child, as well as a day and night nurse, and, surrounded
by every comfort and the prayers of
anxious and loving friends, Tania began her
fight for life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN JULES LISTENS TO A STORY</h3>
</div>

<p>Tania did not die. After a few days the
fever left her, but she was so weak and
frail that the physician in charge of her
case advised Mrs. Curtis to allow her to remain
in the sanatorium for at least a month. When
she should have sufficiently recovered Mrs. Curtis
had decided to take upon herself the responsibility
of the child&#8217;s future. She had been a
constant visitor in the sickroom and during the
long hours she had spent with the imaginative
little one had grown to love her, while Tania in
turn adored the stately, white-haired woman and
clung to her even as she did to Madge, a fact
which pleased Mrs. Curtis more than she would
admit.</p>
<p>Philip Holt was discovered hiding in New
York City. The treasure-box was in the keeping
of old Sal, for Philip had not dared to dispose
of the coins or the jewelry while the detectives
were on the lookout for him. Tom Curtis
saw that the case against Philip Holt was
conducted very quietly. The houseboat girls
had had enough trouble and excitement. Their
treasure was restored to them and they had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
desire ever to hear Philip Holt&#8217;s name mentioned
again.</p>
<p>Tom Curtis was more curious. In questioning
Philip, Tom learned that he himself was innocently
to blame for Philip&#8217;s crime. Holt recalled
to Tom the fact that, on returning from
the houseboat after spending the evening with
Captain Jules and his friends, Tom had mentioned
to his mother that the precious iron safe
was on the houseboat, and that if she cared to
look at the old jewelry again Miss Jenny Ann
would unlock the sideboard drawer and show it
to her the next day. In that moment Philip Holt
decided on his theft, but he did not expect Tania
to thwart him. He had slipped through one of
the open staterooms into the dining room of the
houseboat, broken the lock of the sideboard and
opened the dining room door from the inside to
make his escape. Philip Holt believed that in
taking Tania with him he had accomplished his
own downfall.</p>
<p>If he had not stopped to leave the child at the
deserted farmhouse, his movements would never
have been traced.</p>
<p>Madge Morton was a good deal changed by
the events of the last few weeks. She was so unlike
her usual happy, light-hearted and impetuous
self that Miss Jenny Ann and the houseboat
girls were worried about her. They ardently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
wished that Madge would fly into a temper
again just to show she possessed her old spirit.
But she was very gentle and quiet and liked to
spend a good deal of the time alone.</p>
<p>Miss Jenny Ann consulted with Lillian, Phil
and Eleanor. They decided to write to David
Brewster to ask him to come to spend a few
days with them on the houseboat. Madge was
fond of David and the young man had done such
fine things for himself in the past year that her
friends hoped a sight of him would stir her out
of her depression.</p>
<p>David was visiting Mrs. Randolph&mdash;&#8220;Miss
Betsey&#8221;&mdash;in Hartford. He replied that he
would try to come to Cape May in another week
or ten days, but please not to mention the fact to
Madge until he was more sure of coming.</p>
<p>One bright summer afternoon Madge returned
alone from a long motor ride with Mrs. Curtis
and Tom. She found the houseboat entirely
deserted and remembered that the girls and
Miss Jenny Ann had had an engagement to go
sailing. She curled up on the big steamer chair
and gave herself over to dreams.</p>
<p>A small boat, pulled by a pair of strong arms,
came along close to the deck of the &#8220;Merry
Maid.&#8221; Madge looked up to see Captain Jules&#8217;s
faithful face beaming at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;All alone?&#8221; he called out cheerfully. &#8220;Come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
for a row with me. I&#8217;ll get you back before
tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge wanted to refuse, but she hardly
knew how, so she slipped into the prow of the
skiff and sat there idly facing him.</p>
<p>Captain Jules frowned at the girl&#8217;s pale face,
which looked even paler under the loose twists
of her soft auburn hair. Madge looked older
and more womanly than she had the day the
captain first saw her. There was a deeper
meaning to the upper curves of her full, red lips
and a gentler sweep to the downward droop of
her heavy, black lashes. She was fulfilling the
promise of the great beauty that was to be hers.
It was easy to see that she had the charm that
would make her life full of interest.</p>
<p>Still Captain Jules frowned as though the picture
of Madge and her future did not please him.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much longer are you going to stay at
Cape May, Miss Morton?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>Madge smiled at him. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything
about &#8216;Miss Morton&#8217;s&#8217; plans, but Madge
expects to be here for about two weeks more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently the captain had been calling the
houseboat girls by their first names, as he was
with them so constantly in their trouble. But
he had now decided that he must return to the
formality of the beginning of their acquaintance.
It was best to do so.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And afterward?&#8221; the old sailor questioned,
pretending that he was really not greatly interested
in Madge&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s expression changed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;Of course, Eleanor and
I will go back to &#8216;Forest House&#8217; for a while.
Aren&#8217;t you glad that Uncle has been able to pay
off the mortgage? When Nellie and Lillian go
to Miss Tolliver&#8217;s and Phil to college I don&#8217;t
know exactly what I shall do. Mrs. Curtis and
Tom have asked me to make them a visit in New
York next winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain frowned again. It was well that
Madge was looking over the water and not at
him, for she never could have told why he
looked so displeased.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and Tom Curtis are very good friends,
aren&#8217;t you, Madge?&#8221; said Captain Jules abruptly.</p>
<p>Madge smiled to herself. She felt as though
she were in the witness box. Was her dear old
captain trying to cross-examine her?</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I like Tom better than almost any
one else. He is awfully good to me. You know
you like Tom yourself, so why shouldn&#8217;t I?&#8221; she
ended wickedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like him. Certainly I do. He is a fine, upright
fellow and his money hasn&#8217;t hurt him a
mite, which you can&#8217;t say of the most of us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
But it&#8217;s a different matter with you, young lady,
and I want you to go slowly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am not going at all, Captain,&#8221; laughed
Madge. &#8220;It seems to me that I want only one
thing in the world, and that&#8217;s to find my father.
Sometimes I am afraid that perhaps I shall
never find my father after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules coughed and his voice sounded
rather husky. It had a different note in it
from any that Madge had ever heard him use
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t play the coward, child,&#8221; he said sternly;
&#8220;just because you have had one defeat don&#8217;t
go about the world saying you must give up. It
may be that your father did that once and is
sorry for it now. Keep up the fight. No matter
how many times we may be knocked down in this
world, if we have the right sort of courage we&#8217;ll
always get up again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge sat up very straight. Her blue eyes
flashed back at Captain Jules with an expression
that he liked to see. &#8220;I am not going to
give up my search,&#8221; she answered defiantly.
&#8220;One hears that it is Fate which separates two
persons. If I find Father, I shall feel that I
have won a victory over Fate. But I can&#8217;t help
longing to tell my father that I know that he is
innocent of the fault for which he was disgraced
and dismissed from the Navy, and that I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
the proof in my possession that would make it
clear to all the world as well as to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old captain gave vent to a sudden exclamation
that sounded like a groan. His face
looked strangely drawn under his coat of tan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sick, Captain Jules?&#8221; asked Madge
hastily. &#8220;Do take my place and let me have the
oars. I am sure I can row you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules smiled back at her. &#8220;What
made you think I was sick?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;What
was that you were telling me? How do you
know that your father was guiltless of his fault?
Why, Captain Robert Morton was one of the
kindest men that ever trod a deck, and yet he
was convicted of cruelty to one of his own sailors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Jules,&#8221; continued Madge earnestly,
&#8220;I would like to tell you the whole story if you
have time to listen to it. You know I promised
long ago to tell you. Two years ago, when we
were on the second of our houseboat excursions,
we spent part of our holiday near Old Point
Comfort. There I met the man who had been
my father&#8217;s superior officer. Some unpleasant
things happened between his granddaughter and
me, and she told my father&#8217;s story at a dinner
in order to humiliate me. Long afterward her
grandfather heard of what his granddaughter
had done and he made a statement before my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
friends which cleared my father&#8217;s name. He
confessed to having allowed my father to suffer
for something he had commanded him to do.
My father was too great a man to clear himself
at the expense of his superior officer, so he left
the Navy in disgrace and has never been heard
of since that dreadful time.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much more to tell. Only the old
admiral has died since I met him. However, he
left a paper that was sent to me, in which he acquits
my father of all blame and takes the whole
responsibility for my father&#8217;s act on himself.
Must we go back home, Captain Jules?&#8221; for,
at the end of her speech, Madge observed that
the captain had turned his skiff and was rowing
directly toward the houseboat. He handed
Madge aboard a few moments later with the air
of one whose mind is elsewhere.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Miss Jenny Ann to persuade
the old pearl diver to remain to supper.
With very few words to any of the party he
turned Madge over to her friends and rowed
hurriedly away toward his home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE VICTORY OVER FATE</h3>
</div>

<p>Early the next morning word was brought
by a small boy that Captain Jules Fontaine
wished Miss Madge Morton to
come out to &#8220;The Anchorage&#8221; alone, as he had
some important business that he wished to talk
over with her.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful morning, all fresh sea
breezes and sparkling sunshine. Madge had not
felt so gay in a long time as when the other
houseboat girls fell to guessing as to why Captain
Jules desired her presence at his house.</p>
<p>&#8220;He intends to make you his heiress,
Madge,&#8221; insisted Lillian. &#8220;Then, when you
are an old lady, you can come down here to live
in the house with the roof like three sails, and
ride around in the captain&#8217;s rowboat and sailboat
and be as happy as a clam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge shook her head. &#8220;No such thing, Lillian.
I don&#8217;t believe the captain wants me for
anything important. He may be going to lecture
me, as he did yesterday afternoon. At any
rate, I&#8217;ll be back before long. Please save some
luncheon for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge was surprised when her boat landed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
near &#8220;The Anchorage&#8221; not to see Captain Jules
in his front yard, with his funny pet monkey on
his shoulder, waiting to receive her. She began
to feel afraid that the captain was ill. She had
never been inside his house in all their acquaintance.
But Captain Jules had sent for her, so
there was nothing for her to do but to march up
boldly to his front door and knock.</p>
<p>She lifted the heavy brass knocker, which
looked like the head of a dolphin, and gave three
brisk blows on the closed door.</p>
<p>At first no one answered. The little captain
was beginning to think that the boy who came
to her had made some mistake in his message
and that Captain Jules had gone out in his fishing
boat for the day, when she heard some one
coming down the passage to open the door for
her.</p>
<p>She gave a little start of surprise. A tall,
middle-aged man, with a single streak of white
hair through the brown, was gazing at her curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to see Captain Jules,&#8221; murmured
Madge stupidly, unable to at once recover
from the surprise of finding that Captain Jules
did not live alone.</p>
<p>The strange man invited Madge into a tiny
parlor which rather surprised her. The room
was filled with bookshelves, reaching almost up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
to the top of the wall. The young girl had never
dreamed that her captain was much of a student.
The only things that reminded her of
Captain Jules were the fishnets that were hung
at the windows for curtains and the great sprays
of coral and sponge which decorated the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>The man sat down with his back to the light,
so that he could look straight into Madge&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Jules will be here after a little, Miss
Morton,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;but he wished me
to have a talk with you first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge looked curiously at the unknown man.
She could not obtain a very distinct view of his
face, but she saw that he was very distinguished
looking, that his eyes seemed quite dark, and
that he wore a pointed beard. He did not look
like an American. At least, there was something
in his appearance that Madge did not
quite understand. It struck her that perhaps
the man was a lawyer. It could not be that Lillian
was right in her guess. The treasure in the
iron safe had not yet been sold, so it might be
that this man wished to make some offer for it.
Whoever he might be the silence was becoming
uncomfortable. The little captain decided to
break it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if you wish to talk to me about the
treasure that we found?&#8221; she inquired, smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
&#8220;I would rather that Captain Jules should be in
here when we speak of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger shook his head. He had a very
beautiful voice that in some way fascinated the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t wish to talk about your treasure,
but I do wish to speak of something else that
was lost and is found again. I don&#8217;t know that
you will value it, child, or that it is worth having,
but Captain Jules thinks you might.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s heart began to beat faster. This
strange man had something of great importance
to tell her. She wondered if she had ever seen
him anywhere before. There was something in
his look that was oddly familiar. But why did
he look at her so strangely and why did not her
old friend come to her to end this foolish suspense?</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been down here on a visit to Captain
Jules a number of times this summer and he has
always talked of you,&#8221; went on the fascinating
voice. &#8220;I have longed to see you, but&mdash;&mdash;Miss
Morton, Captain Jules Fontaine and I knew
your father once, long years ago. The news that
you had proof of his innocence made us very
happy last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge would have liked to bounce up and
down in her chair, like an impatient child. Only
her age restrained her. Why didn&#8217;t this man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
tell her the thing he was trying to say? What
made him hesitate so long?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she returned impatiently, &#8220;but
do you know whether my father is alive now?
That is the only thing I care about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge gripped both arms of her chair to control
herself. She was trembling so that she felt
that she must be having a chill, though it was a
warm summer day, for the stranger had risen
and was coming toward her, his face white and
haggard. Then, as he advanced into the brighter
light of the room, Madge saw that his eyes
were very blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father isn&#8217;t dead,&#8221; the man replied
quietly. &#8220;He is here in this very house, and he
cares for you more than all the world in spite of
his long silence!&#8221;</p>
<p>The little captain sprang to her feet, her face
flaming. &#8220;Captain Jules! <i>He</i> is my father?
He seemed so old that I didn&#8217;t realize it. Yet
he has said so many things to me that might
have made me guess he knew everything in the
world about me. Oh, where is he? My own,
own Captain Jules?&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger, whose arms had been outstretched
toward Madge, let them fall at his
sides, but Madge had no eyes for him. Captain
Jules had entered the room and she had flung
herself straight into his kindly arms.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>So, after all, it was Captain Jules Fontaine
who had to make it clear to Madge that he was
not her father, but her father&#8217;s lifelong and devoted
friend. The captain told Madge the story
while he held both her cold hands in his big,
rough ones, and the man who was her own
father sat watching and waiting for her verdict.</p>
<p>Jules Fontaine had never been captain of
anything but a sailing schooner, but he had been
a gunner&#8217;s mate on Captain Robert Morton&#8217;s
ship. He alone knew that Captain Morton had
been forced into the fault that he had committed
by order of his admiral. When Captain
Morton was dismissed from the United States
Naval Service Jules Fontaine, gunner&#8217;s mate,
had procured his discharge and followed the fortunes
of his captain. The two men drifted south
to the tropics. Every American vessel is equipped
with a diving outfit, and some of the men
are taught to go down under the water to examine
the bottoms of the boats. Jules Fontaine
liked the business of diving. When the two men
found themselves in a strange land, without any
occupations, Captain Jules joined his fortunes
with the pearl divers and for many years followed
their perilous trade.</p>
<p>Captain Morton had a harder time to get
along, but after a while he studied foreign languages
and began to translate books. Five
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
years before the two men had come back to the
United States. Since that time Captain Morton
had tried to follow every movement of his
daughter. Captain Jules wanted his friend to
make himself known to his own people, but Robert
Morton feared that they would never forgive
his long silence or his early disgrace. He believed
that Madge would be happier without
knowledge of him. It was her own longing for
her father, reported by Captain Jules, that had
impelled Robert Morton at last to reveal himself
to her.</p>
<p>Madge could not comprehend all of this at
once. She did not even try to do so. She realized
only that, after being without any parents,
she had suddenly come into two fathers at the
same time, her own father and Captain Jules,
who was her more than foster father.</p>
<p>With a low, glad cry she went swiftly across
the room. She did not try to think or to ask
questions at that moment about the past, she
only flung her young arms about her father&#8217;s
neck in a long embrace, feeling that at last she
had some one in the world who was her very
own.</p>
<p>While Madge, her father, and Captain Jules
were trying to see how they could bear the miracle
and shock of their great happiness, a
small, dark object darted into the room and
planted its claws in Madge&#8217;s hair. It pulled
and chattered with all its might.</p>

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>The little captain laughed with the tears in
her eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s that good-for-nothing monkey!&#8221;
she exclaimed as she disentangled the
creature&#8217;s tiny hands. Then she kissed her
father and afterwards Captain Jules. &#8220;Now I
know why this monkey is called Madge, and I
am sorry to have such a jealous, bad-tempered
namesake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain scolded the monkey gently.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you fret about this particular namesake.
If you only knew all the others you have
had! Every single pet that two lonely old men
could get to stay around the house with them we
have named for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Morton did not go back to the houseboat
with his daughter. Madge thought she
would rather tell her friends of her great happiness
alone. She wouldn&#8217;t even let Captain
Jules escort her. &#8220;You&#8217;ll both have plenty of
my society after a while,&#8221; she argued, &#8220;for I
am going to come to keep house for you at &#8216;The
Anchorage&#8217; some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge rowed slowly back to the &#8220;Merry
Maid.&#8221; She was thinking over what she would
say to Miss Jennie Ann and the girls. How
should she announce to them that her quest was
ended, her victory over Fate won?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>As she neared the houseboat she saw that her
companions were gathered on deck, evidently
watching for her. Madge rested on her oars
and waved one hand to them. Four hands waved
promptly back to her. A moment more and
she had come alongside the &#8220;Merry Maid.&#8221; As
she clambered on deck she cast a swift upward
glance at her friends, who, with one accord, were
looking down on her, their faces full of loving
concern.</p>
<p>With a little cry of rapture Madge threw herself
into Miss Jenny Ann&#8217;s arms. &#8220;O, my
dear!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I&#8217;ve found him! I&#8217;ve found
my father!&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was with her faithful mates&#8217; arms
around her that Madge told the strange story
of how her quest had ended in the little sitting
room of &#8220;The Anchorage.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE LITTLE CAPTAIN STARTS ON A JOURNEY</h3>
</div>

<p>Six weeks had passed since Madge Morton&#8217;s
discovery of her father, and many things
had happened since then. It was now toward
the latter part of September, and on a
beautiful fall morning one of the busy steamship
docks in the lower end of New York City
was crowded with a gay company of people.
There were four young girls and three young
men, a beautiful older woman, with soft, white
hair and a look of wonderful distinction; a woman
of about twenty-six or seven, with a man
by her side, who in some way suggested the calling
of the artist; a white-haired old man and an
elderly lady, who, in spite of the fact that she
answered to the name of Mrs. John Randolph,
would have been mistaken anywhere for a New
England spinster. Two men were the only other
important members of the group. One of them
was a distinguished-looking man of about fifty-three
with a rather sad expression, and the last
a bluff old sea captain, whose laugh rang out
clear and hearty above the sound of the many
voices.</p>
<p>In front of the wharf lay a beautiful steam
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
yacht, painted pure white and flying a United
States flag. The boat was of good size and capable
of making many knots an hour, but she
looked like a little toy ship alongside the immense
ocean-going steamers that were entering
and leaving the New York harbor, or waiting
their sailing day at their docks.</p>
<p>One of the girls, dressed in a white serge frock
and wearing a white felt hat, was walking up
and down at the back of the crowd, talking to a
young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;David, more than almost anything, I believe
I appreciate your coming to New York to see me
off. It would have been dreadful to go away for
a whole year, or maybe longer, without having
had a glimpse of you. Who knows what may
happen before I am back again?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s
eyes looked wistfully about among her friends,
although her lips smiled happily.</p>
<p>For a few seconds the young man made no
answer. He had never been able to talk very
readily, now he seemed to wish to think before
he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be a man, Madge, before you are back
again,&#8221; he replied slowly. &#8220;I am twenty now,
so I shall be ready to vote. But, best of all, I
shall be through college and ready to go to
work.&#8221; The young man threw back his square
shoulders. His black eyes looked serious and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
steadfast. &#8220;I am going to make you proud of
me, Madge. You remember I told you so, that
day in the Virginia field, when you helped me out
of a scrape and started me on the right road.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little captain nodded emphatically. &#8220;I
am proud of you already, David,&#8221; she declared
warmly. &#8220;I think it is perfectly wonderful that
you have been able to take two years&#8217; work in
college instead of one, beside helping Mr. Preston
on the farm. You are going to make me
dreadfully ashamed when I come back, by knowing
so much more than I. Phil enters Vassar
this fall and Tom will graduate at Columbia in
another year. I am going to try to study on the
yacht, but I shall be so busy seeing things that I
know I won&#8217;t accomplish very much. Just think,
David, I am going around the world in our own
boat with my father and Captain Jules! Isn&#8217;t
it wonderful how one&#8217;s dreams come true and
things turn out even better than you expect them
to? I believe, if it weren&#8217;t for leaving my beloved
houseboat chums and Mrs. Curtis and
Tom, and Miss Jenny Ann and you, I should be
the happiest girl in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose I count for much, Madge,&#8221;
answered David honestly, &#8220;but I am more
grateful to you than you can know for putting
me on that list. Some day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; The young man
hesitated, then his sober face relaxed and a brilliant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
smile lighted it. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty early for a
fellow like me to be talking about some day, isn&#8217;t
it, Madge?&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge laughed, though she blushed a little
and answered nothing.</p>
<p>Just then Phyllis Alden and a young man in
a lieutenant&#8217;s uniform joined Madge and David
Brewster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Jimmy is saying dreadful
things, Madge,&#8221; announced Phil mournfully.
&#8220;He says he is sure you won&#8217;t come back home
in a year. You&#8217;ll stay over in Europe until you
are grown up or married, or something else, and
you&#8217;ll never be a houseboat girl again!&#8221; Phil&#8217;s
voice broke.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Jimmy looked uncomfortable.
&#8220;See here, Miss Alden,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;I
never said anything as bad as all that. I only
said that perhaps Captain Morton and Captain
Jules would stay longer than a year. Almost
any one would, if they owned that jolly little
yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager you, Lieutenant Jimmy, a torpedo
boat full of the same kind of candy that you sent
us at the end of our second houseboat holiday,
that if you come down to this dock one year
from to-day you will see our yacht, which Captain
Jules has named &#8216;The Little Captain,&#8217;
paying her respects to the Statue of Liberty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
Come, let&#8217;s go and make Father and Captain
Jules convince him, Phil,&#8221; proposed Madge,
hugging Phyllis close to her, as if the thought
of being parted from her for so long as one
year was not to be borne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take that wager, Miss Morton,&#8221; replied
Lieutenant Jimmy jokingly, &#8220;because I would
be so awfully glad to have to pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Madge simply must come back on time, Lieutenant
Jimmy,&#8221; whispered Phil, nodding her
head mysteriously toward a young woman and
a man. &#8220;It&#8217;s a state secret, and I ought not to
tell you, but Miss Jenny Ann and Mr. Theodore
Brown, the artist, are to be married a year from
this fall. We must all be at the wedding. Miss
Jenny Ann couldn&#8217;t possibly be married unless
every one of the &#8216;Mates of the Merry Maid&#8217;
were there. If we can arrange it, Miss Jenny
Ann is going to be married on the houseboat.
Won&#8217;t it be the greatest fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the moment Phil was so cheered at the
thought of another houseboat reunion, though
a whole twelve months off, that she forgot that
her best beloved Madge was to leave in another
half-hour for her trip around the world.</p>
<p>Phyllis and Lieutenant Jimmy were standing
a little behind Madge. David Brewster stopped
to talk to Mrs. Curtis and Tom.</p>
<p>At the far end of the dock Captain Jules Fontaine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
was giving some orders to four sailors who
formed the entire crew of his new yacht, for
the old pearl diver was to pilot his own boat,
which was to sail under Captain Morton&#8217;s orders.
The beautiful little yacht was Captain
Jules&#8217;s own property. The old man had made
a comfortable fortune in his life in the tropics,
but he had little use for it, and no desire, except
to make Madge and her father happy. The little
captain&#8217;s love for the water was what endeared
her most to the old sailor. He could not
be happy away from the sea and he couldn&#8217;t be
happy away from Madge and Captain Morton.
The fortunate girl&#8217;s two fathers had discussed
very seriously Madge&#8217;s own proposal to come
to keep house for them at &#8220;The Anchorage.&#8221;
Both men knew that she could not settle down at
their lonely little house far up the bay and several
miles from the nearest town, which was
Cape May. Wonderful as the fathers thought
Madge, they realized that she was very young
and must go on with her education. They could
not bear to send her away to college after all the
long years of separation. Captain Jules conceived
the brilliant idea of educating her by
taking her on a trip around the world. The old
sailor couldn&#8217;t have borne being cooped up in
liners and on trains with other people to run
them. So Madge&#8217;s dream of a ship all her own,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
which was to sail &#8220;strange countries for to
see,&#8221; had come true with her other good fortune.</p>
<p>Leaving her friends for a moment, Madge
made her way toward the end of the dock to beg
Captain Jules to reassure her friends of their
return at the end of a year. The captain did
not notice her approach. Apparently no one
was looking at her.</p>
<p>On the end of the wharf were gathered three
or four small street arabs. They had no business
on the wharf, which was precisely their reason
for being there. They were playing behind
a number of large boxes and some other luggage,
and, until Madge approached, no one had
observed them. They were having a tug-of-war
and it was hardly a fair battle. Two good-sized
urchins were pulling against one other strong
fellow and another small boy, so thin and pale,
with such dark hair and big, black eyes that, for
the moment, he made Madge think of Tania, who
was almost well enough to leave the sanatorium
and had sent her Fairy Godmother many loving
messages by Mrs. Curtis. Madge stopped for
half a minute to watch the boys. In her stateroom
were so many boxes of candy she would
never be able to eat it all in her trip around the
world. If she only had some of them to give
this lively little group of youngsters!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>Captain Jules was at one side of the wide
wharf with his back toward her and the group
of boys. His yacht was occupying his entire attention.
The street urchins did not realize how
near they were to the edge of the dock because
of the pile of luggage that surrounded them.</p>
<p>The tug-of-war grew exciting. Madge clapped
her hands softly. She had not believed the
smallest rascal had so much strength. Suddenly
the older lad&#8217;s grip broke. The boys fell back
against a pile of trunks that were set uneasily
one above the other. One of the trunks slid into
the water and the smallest lad slipped backward
after it with an almost noiseless splash.
His boy companions stared helplessly after him,
too frightened to make a sound.</p>
<p>Of course, Madge might soon have summoned
help. She did think of it for a brief instant,
for she realized perfectly that her white
serge suit would look anything but smart if she
plunged into the river in it. Then, too, her
friends, Captain Jules, and her father might be
displeased with her. But the little lad had given
her such an agonized, helpless look of appeal as
he struck the water! And his eyes were so like
Tania&#8217;s!</p>
<p>Captain Jules turned around at the sound of
feet running down the dock. David Brewster
and Tom Curtis were side by side. But they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
both looked more surprised than frightened. In
the water, a few feet from the dock, Captain
Jules espied Madge Morton, her white hat floating
off the back of her head, her face and hair
dripping with water. She was smiling in a half-apologetic
and half-nervous way. In one hand
she held a small boy firmly by the collar. &#8220;Fish
us out, somebody?&#8221; she begged. &#8220;I am dreadfully
sorry to spoil my clothes, but this little
wretch would go and fall into the water at the
very last moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Jules and one of his sailors pulled
Madge and the small boy safely onto the wharf
again. The captain frowned at her solemnly,
while David and Tom laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I ever going to keep her out of the
bottom of the sea?&#8221; the captain inquired sternly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I care for the rôle of
playing guardian to a mermaid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge could see Mrs. Curtis, Miss Jenny
Ann, her chums and her father, as well as their
other friends, hurrying down toward the end of
the dock. She gave one swift glance at them,
then she looked ruefully at her own dripping
garments. Tom and David long remembered
her as they saw her at that moment. Her white
dress clung to her slender form; the water was
dripping from her clothing, her cheeks were a
brilliant crimson from embarrassment at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
plight; her red-brown hair glinted in the bright
sunlight, and her blue eyes sparkled with mischief
and dismay. Before any one had a chance
to scold or to reproach her, she had dashed
across the wharf, run aboard the yacht and had
shut herself up in her stateroom.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, dressed in a fresh white
serge frock, she emerged to say good-bye. The
houseboat girls had made up their minds that
not one tear would any one of them shed when
the moment of parting came. Lillian and Phil
stood on either side of Eleanor, for neither of
them had much faith that Nellie could keep her
word when it came to the test.</p>
<p>Madge went first to Mr. and Mrs. John Randolph.
&#8220;Miss Betsey&#8221; took both her hands and
held them gravely. &#8220;Madge, dear, remember I
have always told you that wherever you were
exciting things were sure to happen. You have
convinced me of it again to-day. Now, you are
going around the world and I hope you will see
and know only the best there is in it. Good-bye.&#8221;
Miss Betsey leaned on her distinguished
old husband&#8217;s arm for support and surreptitiously
wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jenny Ann Jones, you promised I wouldn&#8217;t
have to say good-bye to you,&#8221; protested Madge
chokingly. Miss Jenny Ann nodded, while Mr.
Theodore Brown gazed at her comfortingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Madge rallied her courage and smiled at both
of them. &#8220;Do you remember, Jenny Ann,&#8221; she
questioned, &#8220;how on the very first of our houseboat
trips you said that you would marry some
day, just to be able to get rid of the name of
&#8216;Jones&#8217;? I am sure you will like &#8216;Brown&#8217; a
whole lot better.&#8221; Madge turned saucily away
to hide the trembling of her lips.</p>
<p>Mrs. Curtis said nothing. She just kissed
Madge&#8217;s forehead, both rosy cheeks and once
on her red lips. But when the little captain
left her, and Mrs. Curtis turned to find her son
standing near her, his face white and his lips
set, his mother faltered brokenly: &#8220;I am trying
hard not to be selfish, Tom, and I am glad, with
all my heart, that Madge found her father, but
no one will ever know how sorry I am not to
have her for my daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you will some day, after all, Mother,&#8221;
returned Tom steadily. &#8220;We are young, I
know, and neither of us has seen much of the
world. Still, I am fairly sure I know my own
mind. Perhaps Madge will care as much as I
do now when the right time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the last, Madge could not say farewell to
her three chums. Her eyes were so full of tears
that Captain Jules had to lead her aboard the
yacht. She stood on the deck, kissing both
hands to them as long as she could see them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
until their little boat had been towed far out into
the great New York harbor.</p>
<p>Madge&#8217;s father stood by her, watching the
sunlight dance upon the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;My little girl,&#8221; Captain Morton began, with
a view of distracting her attention from the sorrow
of parting, &#8220;I have always forgotten to tell
you that I saw you graduate at Miss Tolliver&#8217;s.
Jules was not with me that day. He knew of
you but never saw you until you went to Cape
May. I wonder I didn&#8217;t betray myself to you
then, dear. It was I who first called out to you
when I saw that arch tottering over your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge nodded. &#8220;I know it now,&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;I must have caught a brief glimpse of
your face. You and Captain Jules sent me the
wonderful pearl. We never could guess from
whom it had come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Captain Morton, &#8220;Jules and
I had kept it for you for many years. We determined
that sooner or later you should have
it. I shall never forget the day when Jules came
hurrying into &#8216;The Anchorage&#8217; with the news
that he had seen you and talked with you about
me. He was sure that you were our Madge even
before he knew your name to be Morton. It
was wonderful to hear that your dearest wish
was to find me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madge slipped her arm into that of her father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
and laid her curly head against his shoulder.
&#8220;If it was Fate that separated us, then I shall
never be dismayed by it again, for love and determination
are far greater and through them
I found you,&#8221; she declared softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am very selfish to take you
away for a whole year from Mrs. Curtis and
Tom and the houseboat girls,&#8221; said her father,
almost wistfully. &#8220;You are not sorry you are
going to spend the next few months with no one
but two old men for company?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I spent eighteen years without you,&#8221;
reminded Madge. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe I ought
to begin to make up for lost time? Just think,&#8221;&mdash;her
eyes grew tender with the pride of possession&mdash;&#8220;I
have what I&#8217;ve longed for more
than anything else in the world, my father&#8217;s
love. Perhaps when we come back next year
we can anchor the &#8216;Little Captain&#8217; in Pleasure
Bay and invite the &#8216;Merry Maid&#8217; and her crew
to visit us. Then Miss Jenny Ann could be married
on the houseboat. We must be very sure
to come home on time if we carry out that plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, Captain Madge,&#8221; smiled her father,
&#8220;unless our good ship fails us we&#8217;ll anchor
next September in Pleasure Bay and send a
special invitation to the crew of the &#8216;Merry
Maid&#8217; to meet us there.&#8221;</p>
